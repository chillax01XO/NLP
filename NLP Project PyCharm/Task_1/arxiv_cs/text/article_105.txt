Abstract
As large vision language models(LVLMs)
rapidly advance, concerns about their poten-
tial to learn and generate social biases and
stereotypes are increasing. Previous studies on
LVLM’s stereotypes face two primary limita-
tions: metrics that overlooked the importance of
content words, and datasets that overlooked the
effect of color. To address these limitations, this
study introduces new evaluation metrics based
on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM). We
also propose BASIC, a benchmark for assess-
ing gender, race, and color stereotypes. Using
SCM metrics and BASIC, we conduct a study
with eight LVLMs to discover stereotypes. As
a result, we found three findings. (1) The SCM-
based evaluation is effective in capturing stereo-
types. (2) LVLMs exhibit color stereotypes in
the output along with gender and race ones. (3)
Interaction between model architecture and pa-
rameter sizes seems to affect stereotypes. We
release BASIC publicly on [anonymized for
review].
1 Introduction
As large vision-language models (LVLMs) con-
tinue to advance, they are increasingly being uti-
lized in perceiving visual images across diverse
domains (Xu et al., 2024; Gu et al., 2024; Wang
et al., 2025). However, when employing LVLMs,
it is essential to acknowledge that models may be
affected by stereotypes, potentially influencing the
models’ perception. In humans, a stereotype refers
to cognitive generalizations about the characteris-
tics of individuals belonging to a specific social
group (VandenBos, 2007). So, people often judge
others unconsciously based on their visual appear-
ance such as gender, race, and color (Cloutier et al.,
2005; Eberhardt et al., 2004; Elliot et al., 2013).
Given that LVLMs are usually trained on human-
generated data, it is likely that they have learned
†Equal contribution.human stereotypes. As a result, LVLMs sometimes
exhibit harmful stereotypes, leading to bad conse-
quences (Jiang et al., 2024; Howard et al., 2025;
Fraser and Kiritchenko, 2024). Therefore, the need
to identify such stereotypes is becoming impor-
tant. Researchers recently designed various bench-
marks to quantify stereotypes in LVLMs (Adewumi
et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a,b; Sathe et al., 2024;
Fraser and Kiritchenko, 2024).
Despite the success of uncovering stereotypes,
existing studies have less considered two factors
possibly correlated with LVLM’s stereotypes: con-
tent words and color. First, regarding content words,
we suspect that LVLMs may use positive sentiment
words when generating stereotypical content. Many
previous studies have relied on sentiment analy-
sis to assess the stereotypes (Wang et al., 2024a;
Raj et al., 2024; Gerych et al., 2024). While this
approach has contributed, sentiment-based eval-
uation cannot fully mirror how humans evaluate
stereotypes. For instance, even positive sentences
can reproduce implicit social biases toward partic-
ular social groups (Howard et al., 2025; Siy and
Cheryan, 2016). Therefore, to evaluate stereotypes
more precisely, it is necessary to adopt a socio-
psychological framework that captures such im-
plicit biases in text and complements sentiment
analysis. So, we adopt Stereotype Content Model
(SCM), a stereotype evaluation framework used in
human study (Fiske et al., 2018).
Second, regarding color, LVLMs may exhibit
stereotypes because of different colors in the image.
Previously, researchers in vision-language model
reported that model responds inconsistently due to
image differences, even when images contain simi-
lar scenes (Wu et al., 2025; Kantipudi et al., 2020;
Liang et al., 2025). So, studies on stereotypes have
employed image pairs to control such differences.
Previous attempts successfully built controlled im-
age pairs, however, they overlooked the potential
impact of color tone. As humans are influenced bycolor differences (Elliot and Maier, 2013; Kaya and
Epps, 2004; Wexner, 1954), we suspect that color
influences stereotypes in LVLMs. To justify such
suspicion, we suggest a way to evaluate whether
LVLMs affected by different color tones.
Thus, in this paper, we propose two metrics in-
spired by SCM and a new Benchmark for assessing
stereotypes with Image Colors, BASIC. Addition-
ally, we attempt to examine which part of LVLMs
affect stereotypes, by comparing different model
architectures. We believe that a systematic com-
parison between model architectures can hint at
components relevant to stereotypes. As a result,
this paper has the following contributions:
1.Two SCM-based metrics: Based on social psy-
chology, we propose automatic metrics that
can complement sentiment metrics.
2.BASIC benchmark: We suggest a benchmark
that can separate the effect of colors from
other stereotypes.
3.Systematic analysis: By comparing eight
LVLMs, we found the effect of model archi-
tecture and size on stereotype is limited.
2 Related Work
This section reviews existing research in terms of
(1) used metrics, (2) designed benchmarks, and (3)
tested LVLMs for analyzing stereotypes. The fol-
lowing paragraphs elaborate each of these points.
First, regarding content words, prior studies have
mainly assessed model responses based on senti-
ment polarity (Inoshita and Zhou, 2024; Hu et al.,
2025; Gerych et al., 2024), which limits their abil-
ity to capture the subtle meanings embedded in
text. In the case of LVLMs, responses often ex-
hibit positive sentiments because they were rein-
forced by human feedback (Li et al., 2024), mak-
ing it difficult to detect stereotypes solely through
sentiment-based metrics. Therefore, more sophis-
ticated measures that directly target stereotypes
are needed. In response to this limitation, recent
work has begun incorporating social-psychological
evaluation frameworks to analyze stereotypes. For
instance, (Howard et al., 2025) was influenced by
the Stereotype Content Model (SCM). The study
used the dictionary from (Nicolas et al., 2021) to
measure the frequency of SCM-related words in im-
age captions. However, this approach is limited by
its reliance on word frequency, without accounting
for contextual or derived meanings.
Figure 1: Examples from our BASIC dataset. Top row
shows chess players with different colors (white, blue,
red), retaining race and gender. Bottom row shows DJs
with different race or gender, retaining white color.
Second, regarding benchmarks, prior studies
have emphasized the importance of constructing
paired images to assess stereotypes of LVLMs. Tra-
ditional studies constructed diverse images based
on common themes such as gender or race, and
compared average evaluation scores across these
thematic sets (Mandal et al., 2023; Janghorbani
and De Melo, 2023; Qiu et al., 2023). However,
such methods often suffer from insufficient con-
trol over confounding variables unrelated to the
targeted stereotype. For example, if gender, race,
and background all change simultaneously, any ob-
served bias cannot be attributed purely to gender
when aiming to examine gender-related stereotypes.
To address this limitation, recent works have pro-
posed that changing a targeted attribute while keep-
ing the rest of the image nearly identical (Kim
et al., 2025; Howard et al., 2025, 2024; Fraser and
Kiritchenko, 2024). While these studies devote con-
siderable effort to image construction, unintended
color differences still appear in the generated im-
ages. Considering the visual differences can influ-
ence the model’s internal representations (De and
Pedersen, 2021; Kantipudi et al., 2020; Liang et al.,
2025), thereby potentially affecting the manifesta-
tion of stereotypes. Thus, color differences should
be considered in stereotype evaluation frameworks
to provide a more accurate evaluation.
Lastly, regarding model architecture, researchers
recently investigated whether the model architec-
ture affects stereotypes. Though previous studies
have identified stereotypes within a limited set of
models (Raj et al., 2024; Sathe et al., 2024), they
did not clearly mention which architectural choice
cause stereotypes. So, recently, researchers havebegun to identify causal relationships (Wu et al.,
2024; Wang et al., 2024a). Despite their success, it
is yet questionable whether their findings could be
generalized to large-sized LVLMs with more than
50 billion parameters. So, we need to consider a
broader range of models during the model selection,
in terms of parameter size.
3 BASIC Benchmark
In this study, we aim to separately examine the ef-
fect of color tone in the analysis of stereotypes pro-
duced by LVLMs. There are various visual compo-
nents in person images that can influence stereotype
formation: gender, race, background, and color.
Since these elements appear together in a single
image, it is essential to separate the impact of each
factor on the model’s responses. To examine the
potential impact of such differences, we construct a
paired image dataset that considers not only gender
and race but also color, as shown in Figure 1.
We created the dataset using three primary col-
ors: white, red, and blue. While a broader range
of colors could have been included, we selected
these particular ones based on cognitive factors
related to human perception. Specifically, prior re-
search has shown that humans tend to associate red,
blue, and white with particular emotions, cognitive
judgments, or stereotypes (Elliot and Maier, 2013;
Kaya and Epps, 2004; Wexner, 1954). Therefore,
we adapted the procedure proposed by (Howard
et al., 2024) to construct a dataset with controlled
color tones and designed a six-step process1.
For the experimental analysis of model stereo-
types, gender and race categorizations were
adopted from previous studies (Karkkainen and
Joo, 2021; Howard et al., 2024). Specifically,
gender was determined based on biological sex,
while race was classified into six predefined
groups: African-American, Asian, Caucasian, In-
dian, Latino, and Middle Eastern. We acknowledge
that there is a broader spectrum of gender and race
beyond those considered in this study. This selec-
tion was made solely for experimental purposes
and is not intended to exclude any group.
Step 1: Constructing Occupation List. To create
paired images, we started by choosing a common
occupation for the individuals depicted in each
image. Following the approach of Howard et al.
1The generation code is available at the GitHub URL. De-
tailed prompts and parameter settings for each step are pro-
vided in the Appendix A(2024), we collected a list of occupations from stud-
ies (Nadeem et al., 2021; Chuang et al., 2023; Naik
and Nushi, 2023). After removing duplicates, we
obtained a list of 181 occupations. All subsequent
steps are performed for each of 181 occupations.
Step 2: Creating action. We considered various
actions that could be associated with each occupa-
tion. Since a single image cannot cover all possible
actions of a specific occupation, multiple images
describing different actions are required for each
occupation. To achieve this, we adapted a prompt
from (Sathe et al., 2024) and used GPT-4 to gener-
ate five distinct scenarios for each occupation.
Step 3: Generating Seed Images. For each of the
five actions associated with a given occupation, we
generated a seed image as a baseline for transfor-
mation. To ensure stability in subsequent image
manipulation steps, the seed image was generated
using an Asian male wearing white clothing on
a gray background. This step was performed us-
ing the Stable Diffusion XL Text-to-Image model,
which generated high-resolution images (1024 ×
1024 pixels) based on the scenario corresponding
to each occupation (Podell et al., 2023). We em-
ployed negative prompts (Ban et al., 2024) to en-
hance image quality and ensure alignment with the
intended depiction. A negative prompt is an input
method that specifies unwanted attributes, guiding
the model to avoid including them in the generated
images. Specifically, we included terms such as
“low resolution”, “bad anatomy”, and “any color
except white” in the negative prompts.
Step 4: Controlling Gender and Race. Based on
a seed image, we generate paired images that re-
flect various combinations of gender and race. In
this stage, we utilize the Image-to-Image model of
Stable Diffusion XL to modify the seed image ac-
cording to the specified race and gender attributes.
We retain the contextual information conveyed by
the scenario while altering only the race and gen-
der of the original image. To ensure that the pose,
position, and background remain consistent with
the seed image, we adopt negative prompts such as
"different pose, position, and background."
Step 5: Controlling Color. Based on the images
generated in Step 4, we further modify the color
tone of each image to either blue or red, while main-
taining the same race and gender conditions. To
ensure that the intended color is clearly reflected in
the output, we use negative prompts. For example,Red Green Blue
Redvs.White 0.12 -3.06 -2.43
Blue vs.White -5.37 -4.87 -0.52
Table 1: RGB value changes (%) in red/blue images
compared to white seed image
when generating blue-toned images, we explicitly
add phrases such as “white clothes, red clothes, any
color except blue” to the negative prompts used in
Step 4. Through this step, we obtain a total of 180
images per scenario ( = 5×2×6×3).
Step 6: Filtering. To ensure the quality of the fi-
nal dataset, we conducted a filtering process based
on three criteria. First, we evaluated the semantic
similarity between the 32,580 generated images
and their corresponding text prompts. We normal-
ized the embeddings of both image and text using
CLIP, then computed the cosine similarity between
them. Only images with a similarity score of 0.2
or higher were retained in the dataset. Second, we
included only those images that passed the NSFW
filtering, thereby excluding any potentially unsafe
content that may have been generated. Lastly, we
retained only occupations for which all 180 image
variations passed both filtering conditions. If any
single image was filtered out, the entire occupation
was excluded from the analysis to maintain consis-
tency in the number of actions and attributes across
occupations for comparative analysis.
Through the above procedures, we generated a
total of 18,360 images across 102 occupations. Af-
ter completing all image generations, we assessed
whether the color tones were clearly distinguish-
able by calculating the RGB scale differences be-
tween the red or blue images and their correspond-
ing white counterparts. As shown in Table 1, the
constructed dataset actively suppresses non-target
colors to emphasize the intended color tone.
4 Experimental Setup
Using the dataset, we experiment whether LVLMs
reveal different stereotypes across different gender,
race, and colors. In this section, we illustrate our
experimental design to evaluate stereotypes based
on Stereotypical Content Model (SCM) of social
psychology. We first illustrate how we collected
descriptions from LVLMs for each image (Section
4.1). Next, we explain the existing sentiment-based
metric and our two proposed SCM-based metrics(Section 4.2). Then, we explain how we conducted
analyses to figure out the stereotypes on gender,
race, and colors, from the data (Section 4.3). Lastly,
we elaborate LVLMs compared (Section 4.4).
4.1 Collecting Description
As we want to compare descriptions between dif-
ferent images to discover stereotypes, we input
an image and a prompt to LVLMs. For each im-
age, we start a session by feeding the image to an
LVLM. Then, we ask the LVLM to generate de-
scriptions about the image, using an open-ended
question. Specifically, we used following question:
"Describe this person objectively." Using the de-
scription paragraph generated by the LVLM, we
extract metrics for statistical analysis and conduct
a simple qualitative analysis.
We selected the above question prompt because
of two reasons. First, the prompt does not imply any
specific situation or assumption. As LVLMs may
produce different calculation result when we pro-
vide different situation prompt, implying any situa-
tion could lead to a specific stereotype. So, to focus
solely on the effect of input images, we selected not
to impose any situation within the prompt. Second,
the prompt does not provide any specific choices.
We thought that providing choices can also impose
a new code of conduct: generated answer should
be one of the choices.
4.2 Metrics
4.2.1 Existing sentiment-based metric
Following previous work (Wang et al., 2024a; In-
oshita and Zhou, 2024; Hu et al., 2025), we used
V ADER (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014) to assess the
sentiment of a description. Among the various
sentiment-based metrics, researchers usually adopt
V ADER because the model is trained on the corpus
from social media, which might contain stereotypi-
cal content. To obtain a score, we input a descrip-
tion of an image into V ADER. After V ADER’s com-
putation procedure finished, we used the output of
V ADER as the sentiment score of the description.
4.2.2 Our proposed SCM-based metrics
As sentiment-based metrics may not sufficiently
consider content words, we propose two new met-
rics following SCM: competence andwarmth . Be-
fore explaining metrics, we first elaborate how we
operationally defined these two dimensions in our
context, following (Fiske et al., 2018). The com-
petence dimension measures how capable the de-scriber evaluates the ability of the person in the
image to achieve own goal2. And, the warmth di-
mension measures how positively or negatively a
describer evaluates the intention of the person3.
To quantize two main axes of stereotype, warmth
and competence, we propose a projection-based
method; we project word embeddings into a vector
space spanned by warmth and competence, inspired
by studies about stereotypes in LLMs (Fraser et al.,
2021; Omrani et al., 2023; Kim and Johnson, 2025).
As SCM utilizes human intuition to evaluate a de-
scription, we chose to model such intuition using
word embeddings. Mathematically, we assumed
that a sentence embedding xis a linear combina-
tion of independent basis vectors: warmth uw, com-
petence uc, and other basis vectors vis which are
orthogonal to uwanduc. In other words, for any
sentence embedding x, there exist corresponding
real numbers αw(x), αc(x)andβi(x)such that
x=αwuw(x) +αcuc(x) +X
iβi(x)vi.(1)
So, we can compute orthogonal projection of x
onto warmth-competence plane with two numbers
αw(x)andαc(x), the projected coordinate on the
plane. These numbers show how much warmth and
competence should be combined together to have
a similar meaning of the given sentence x. So, we
interpret them as scores quantifying warmth and
competence in SCM.
To implement the above idea, we need basis vec-
tors. We normalized the average embedding of cor-
responding representative words. As a embedding
model, we used Sentence-Transformer (Reimers
and Gurevych, 2019). Let WandCbe sets of
words representing warmth and competence, re-
spectively. We compute uvectors by computing
average embedding ¯wand¯c:
¯w=1
|W|X
x∈WST(x), uw=1
∥¯w∥2¯w,(2)
¯c=1
|C|X
x∈CST(x), uc=1
∥¯c∥2¯c,(3)
where ST(·)is the Sentence-Transformer.
Using these two unit vectors, we compute
warmth αwand competence αcof a sentence xas a
2Fiske et al. (2018) mentioned following six words indi-
cate high competence: competent ,confident ,capable ,efficient ,
intelligent ,skillful
3Also, they mentioned following seven words indicate high
warmth: friendly ,well-intentioned ,trustworthy ,warm ,good-
natured ,sincereprojection. We first calculate dot products between
x:=ST(x)and basis vectors.
d=u⊤
wuc, d w(x) =x⊤uw, d c(x) =x⊤uc.
(4)
Using these dot products and Equation 1, we obtain
the projection coordinates as follows:
αw(x) =dw(x)−d·dc(x)
1−d2, (5)
αc(x) =dc(x)−d·dw(x)
1−d2. (6)
4.3 Analyses
We use two analysis methods to examine stereo-
types in LVLMs: statistical test and pointwise mu-
tual information (PMI). First, for statistical tests,
we conducted paired t-test. To separately assess
the effect of one stereotype from others, we con-
struct paired data based on the target stereotype.
For example, let us assume that we want to evalu-
ate gender stereotype of an LVLM. Then, from the
BASIC benchmark, we construct pairs of images
whose gender is different and whose other aspects
(race, color, scene, and occupation) are the same.
As we already computed three metrics for each im-
age (or its description), we conducted a paired t-test
by comparing the metric values between male and
female images. For race and colors, we conducted
paired t-test in a pairwise way; for example, we
tested for each pair of two different colors.
Second, for PMI, we computed PMI between
each aspect and words. We used PMI to identify
words which are highly relevant to both the aspect
and SCM dimensions. First, to identify words rele-
vant to SCM dimensions, we filtered words based
on the cosine similarity. We computed cosine simi-
larity between w:=ST(w)and basis vectors and
discarded words whose similarity is in between -
0.5 and 0.54. Then, we compute PMI of a word w
and an aspect a(e.g., red tone) as follows:
PMI (w;a) = log2P(w|a)
P(w), (7)
where P(w|a)indicates the frequency of word w
in descriptions of image with aspect a, and P(w)
means the frequency of word win the entire set.
For each aspect, we selected 20 words whose PMI
scores are highest. By collecting common words
across models, we can identify stereotypes ap-
peared in majority of models.
4We used 0.5≃cos(60◦)to exclude words whose direc-
tion is near orthogonal to w.Llama Instruct Pixtral Qwen

4.4 Tested models
To conduct a systematic analysis between mod-
els, we selected eight LVLMs according to fol-
lowing three criteria. First, we used open-sourced
models whose architecture is known and already
tuned on visual instructions. Second, we selected
LVLMs which provides at least two different pa-
rameter sizes. Third, we used models which can
be grouped with other models, according to image
input method or backbone language models (LMs).
As a result, we selected the following eight mod-
els, as shown in Table 2. Note that Llama 3.2 and
InstructBLIP uses backbone LMs from same lin-
eage, Llama. Unlike Llama 3.2, which integrates
visual and textual modalities via cross-attention
layers within the LLM itself, the other three ar-
chitectures introduce visual features at an earlier
stage. After processing the outputs of the image en-
coder through modules such as Q-Former, adapters,
or projectors, they feed them directly into the lan-
guage model input sequence. Additionally, small
models have similar parameter sizes, such as 7B
or 12B. Implementation details (e.g., temperature
settings) are described in the Appendix B.
5 Results
To analyze whether three image attributes cause dif-
ferent stereotype levels, we conducted paired t-tests
using three evaluation metrics. Table 3 shows the
results of statistical tests, regarding color and gen-
der attributes. Due to the page limit, here we only
present two of three attributes; we present the pair-
wise comparison between different race attributes
in Appendix C. Likewise, here we describe some
common words discovered from PMI analyses, and
the detailed result of PMI analyses is illustrated in
Appendix D. The following paragraphs describe
the results regarding each metric.V ADER: Regarding color, the differences in sen-
timent scores were not consistent between models,
though models sometimes exhibit biases in some
cases (Rows 1-3). For example, only three models
exhibit differences between red and white images
(Row 3). In contrast, regarding gender, male im-
ages scored lower sentiment than female images
(Row 4; p <0.05for all).
Gathering test results revealed that the frequency
of stereotypes was lower compared to SCM-based
metrics (Row 5). Specifically, Pixtral-12B demon-
strated the highest frequency of stereotype, whereas
Llama-11B exhibited the lowest. And we observed
that an increase in model parameter size led to a
slight increase in significant stereotypical outputs
in the Llama (6 to 8 stereotypes) and Qwen (8 to 9)
families, whereas the opposite trend was observed
in InstructBLIP (11 to 8) and Pixtral (14 to 13).
Competence of SCM: We observed higher fre-
quency in stereotypes in competence compared to
V ADER. Also, the result is somewhat independent
from V ADER, as the correlation between them
was near zero ( r= 0.014,p < 0.001). Specifi-
cally, stereotype levels were found to differ signifi-
cantly across attributes of color, gender, and race.
For example, regarding color, blue images showed
lower competence than red (Row 1; p <0.001for
all models) and white (Row 2; p <0.001except
for InstructBLIP-7B). PMI result revealed similar
phenomenon; red and white were associated with
high competence words, such as BRIGHT ,STRONG ,
COMPETITIVE (for red), CLEAN ,TECHNOLOGI -
CAL, and EXPERTISE (white).
Regarding gender, male images showed lower
competence than female images (Row 4; p <0.001
except for Qwen-7B). PMI result supports this
observation; male images were associated with
DISTINGUISHED ,RESPONSIBILITY ,INTELLEC -
TUAL , whereas female images were more linked to
GRACEFUL ,ELEGANT ,BEAUTY .
Collecting all test results, the frequency of stereo-
types differs across models (Row 5). Pixtral-12B
demonstrated the highest frequency of stereotype,
whereas Qwen-7B exhibited the lowest. Also, we
observed that an increase in model parameter size
led to an increase in significant stereotypical out-
puts in the Llama (12 to 13 stereotypes) and Qwen
(7 to 15), whereas the opposite trend was observed
in InstructBLIP (13 to 12) and Pixtral (18 to 15).
Warmth of SCM: We also observed higher fre-
quency in stereotypes in warmth compared toLlama 3.2 InstructBLIP Pixtral Qwen 2.5

V ADER. Again, the result is somewhat indepen-
dent from V ADER with a very weak correlation
(r= 0.189,p <0.001). Similar to competence,
we found significant stereotypes in the result. Re-
garding color, red images showed lower warmth
than blue (Row 1; p <0.001) and white (Row 3;
p <0.05). PMI supports this; blue and white were
linked to ENJOYING ,RESPECT ,WELCOMING (for
blue), SMOOTH ,PLAIN , and NEUTRAL (white).
Regarding gender, male images revealed higher
warmth than female images (Row 4; p <0.001ex-
cept for Qwen-72B). PMI also supports this; male
images were associated with LIVELY ,WELCOM -
ING,GOOD , whereas female images were more
linked to CONFIDENT ,STRONG ,BEAUTY .
Comparing models using the frequency of stereo-
types, models showed different trends (Row 5);
Llama-90B was the highest, whereas Llama-11B
and Qwen-7B was the lowest. An increase in model
parameter size led to more significant stereotypi-
cal outputs in the Llama (10 to 16 stereotypes)
and Qwen (10 to 14) families, whereas the oppo-
site trend was observed in InstructBLIP (15 to 12
stereotypes) and Pixtral (15 to 14).
6 Discussion
6.1 Effectiveness of SCM metrics
Our result suggests that using both SCM-based
metrics and sentiment metrics provides more com-prehensive view on stereotypes. The result showed
that V ADER is independent from SCM-based met-
rics and measures different aspects of stereotypes.
V ADER analyzes the emotional content of a sen-
tence at a surface level by examining its positive
or negative polarity, thus simplifying stereotypes
to matters of sentiment. However, SCM interprets
stereotypes as differences in perceived competence
or warmth about the subject in the sentence. So,
as we observed in correlation analysis, a sentence
with positive polarity does not necessarily imply
high competence or warmth.
Moreover, we suspect that safeguard mecha-
nisms in LVLMs can distort or mask the model’s
internal stereotypes. These models are often explic-
itly trained to avoid harmful contents or a negative
tone on possibly stereotypical topics, thereby influ-
encing sentiment scores regardless of underlying
bias. So, sentiment polarity-based metrics, such as
V ADER, may not sufficiently capture bias. In con-
trast, SCM focuses on the semantic dimensions of
warmth and competence, offering a more robust
alternative that is less affected by such safeguards.
6.2 Existence of Color Stereotypes
Color plays a significant role in shaping stereo-
types, as it demonstrates clear patterns in the di-
mensions of warmth and competence. We believe
that these stereotypes develop because the model
internalizes sociocultural associations present inimage-text data during its pretraining phase. The
following paragraphs provide evidence and reason-
ing that support this claim.
Regarding competence, we suspect that a stereo-
typical association between color tones and the
capability of the subject may affect the score. For
instance, red color may symbolize warning or ag-
gression but can also be interpreted as a sign of
passion or determination (Elliot and Maier, 2013;
Gnambs et al., 2015). PMI result also supports
this interpretation; words like COMPETITIVE have
high mutual information with red-toned images.
Similarly, white-toned images were also linked
with EXPERTISE orTECHNOLOGICAL , mirroring
stereotypes that professional, highly-competent oc-
cupations wear white-colored uniforms (Crutzen
and Adam, 2022; Adam and Galinsky, 2012). Be-
cause such stereotypes were already integrated
in human-labeled caption dataset, red and white
showed higher competence than blue in the result.
Regarding warmth, we suspect that frequent pair-
ing of certain color tones with trustworthy may
have increased warmth scores. For example, blue
may symbolize calmness and stability (Kaya and
Epps, 2004; Wexner, 1954). Similarly, white may
convey a sense of softness and purity (Na and Suk,
2014; Kaya and Epps, 2004). Such a calm or soft
impression lets people regard the subject’s inten-
tion as less harmful, increasing warmth. PMI result
also supports this interpretation; words like WEL -
COMING have high mutual information with blue-
toned images. Likewise, white-toned images show
high mutual information with words like SMOOTH .
Thus, higher warmth scores for blue and white im-
ages imply that LVLMs learned such human stereo-
types about the subject’s intention.
6.3 Differences between Models
Our results also indicate that model architecture
may not be the primary factor influencing the
strength or weakening of stereotypes. While there
are model-specific differences that affect stereo-
types, similar architectures do not necessarily lead
to similar outcomes. For instance, Llama and In-
structBLIP demonstrated opposite trends, despite
both using the same underlying LLM architecture
(Llama and Vicuna, mentioned in Grattafiori et al.
(2024); Chiang et al. (2023)). Similarly, Pixtral
and Qwen also exhibited opposite trends, even
though both encode visual inputs using Vision
Transformer-based modules and feed the projected
hidden states into the LLM decoder as image to-kens (Agrawal et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2025). So,
the effect of architecture seems relatively small.
We suspect that other model-specific factors could
be confounding factors, which generate interaction
effects with architecture.
Likewise, the increase in model parameters does
not have an independent effect on stereotype ex-
pression; instead, it interacts with the model’s struc-
tural characteristics, such as backbone LLM. Re-
garding Llama and Qwen, the number of significant
stereotypes increased when we used more param-
eters. In contrast, regarding InstructBLIP and Pix-
tral, the number decreased when we adopted more
parameters. Also, when we compare different archi-
tectures with similar sizes (e.g., 10B models), no
model exhibited dominant stereotypes compared
to others in all metrics. So we conclude the effect
of parameter sizes and architecture are not easily
distinguishable from each other.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced a comprehensive eval-
uation framework that adopts Stereotype Contents
Model (SCM) and moves beyond sentiment-based
assessments of stereotypes. We also presented BA-
SIC, a novel benchmark designed to isolate and
evaluate the role of image color tones in the for-
mation of stereotypes by Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs).
Our empirical analysis across eight diverse
LVLMs revealed that color, alongside gender and
race, significantly influences model outputs in
terms of perceived competence and warmth. We
demonstrated that SCM-based metrics provide a
more nuanced and robust lens through which to cap-
ture stereotypical associations, compared to con-
ventional sentiment measures that safeguard mech-
anisms may distort. Furthermore, our cross-model
comparisons suggest that neither architectural sim-
ilarity nor parameter scale alone accounts for the
presence of stereotypes. Instead, we observed com-
plex interactions between model-specific factors
which collectively shape the stereotypes.
These findings underscore two points: (1) the
adoption of semantically informed evaluation meth-
ods when auditing stereotypes in LVLMs and (2)
the need for more careful consideration of visual
attributes such as color. We hope BASIC and SCM
metrics will serve as a useful tool for future stud-
ies seeking to address the nuanced dynamics of
stereotype formation in multimodal AI systems.Limitations
While our study presents SCM-based evaluation
metrics and introduces BASIC, a benchmark devel-
oped to assess stereotypes in LVLMs, three limi-
tations yet remain. First, our findings may not be
fully independent from other visual attributes. In
our study, we focused on three specific colors to
investigate stereotypes in LVLMs. Though those
colors are selected based on studies about human
perception and we found such stereotype is present
in LVLMs, we believe that other color tones (e.g.,
yellow or green) may show different patterns of
stereotypes. Similarly, other visual elements may
affect our experiment; facial expression, brightness,
or posture may still have a potential influence on
the model outputs. As these visual elements can
generate interaction effect with color stereotypes,
we need further studies on investigating these vi-
sual elements to understand stereotypes in LVLM.
Second, our findings just provided a hint at how
architectural differences affect LVLM stereotypes.
Though we designed a systematic comparison be-
tween eight LVLMs in terms of parameter size
and model architecture, our result only provides
correlation between them. To identify causal re-
lationship or possible cause of stereotypes from
model-specific architectures, we need to further
control other factors such as training data and safe-
guards. Controlling such factors usually requires
pre-training from the scratch, which requires a lot
of time and machine resources. Thus, we reported
correlation without conducting an experiment for
identifying causality. However, as causal relation-
ship should be discovered to reduce stereotypes
in LVLMs, we call further research on identifying
such possible causes from model architecture.
Third, we conducted our experiment only in En-
glish. So, our experimental result is based on En-
glish culture. As Language-specific or culturally
nuanced biases exist, LVLMs may provide differ-
ent responses when we use different languages.
This implies that the result might vary across differ-
ent languages or culture. Thus, conducting similar
experiment with different languages may provide
different insights.

A Generation procedure of BASIC
Figure 2 shows the entire pipeline for generating
BASIC benchmark. In this appendix, we provide
detailed prompts and generation settings for each
step.
A.1 Step 1: Constructing Occupation List
Table 4 lists all 102 occupations used in our image
generation experiments. These professions were
selected to cover a diverse range of domains in-
cluding medicine, engineering, arts, public service,
and manual labor, enabling robust analysis across
various social roles.
A.2 Step 2: Creating action
We used the following prompts for generating ac-
tions for each occupation.
System prompt:
You are an NLP assistant whose
purpose is to generate prompts in
a specific format.
User prompt:
Generate 20 prompts in the given
format for the given occupation:
{TARGET_OCCUPATION} Each
prompt should be in the format "A
<occupation> doing <action>" with
no more than 20 words per prompt.
Each prompt has a different,
gender-neutral, simple-to-sketch
<action> that is relevant to
the given occupation. Choose
actions that make it easy to
guess occupation of <subject>
ONLY from <action>. Output oneprompt on each line. Do NOT print
ANY additional information.
A.3 Step 3: Generating Seed Images
For each pair of occupation and prompt, we first
create a single seed portrait of an Asian man
wearing pure-white attire. Generation is performed
with the Stable Diffusion XL text-to-image pipeline
(stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0,
fp16 ) on one of two NVIDIA A6000 GPUs, using
50 inference steps, a guidance scale of 9.0, and a
resolution of 1024 × 1024.
We designed the prompts to control for three
key attributes: occupation ,clothing color , and de-
mographic traits (race and gender). The template
prompt for generating seed image is as follows:
Asian man, {occupation prompt} ,
wearing pure white clothes,
gray background, professional
photography, high detail, high
quality
For example, a prompt for doctor is as follows:
Asian man, a confident and
professional doctor standing in
a hospital corridor, wearing
pure white clothes, completely
white outfit, gray background,
professional photography, high
detail, high quality
To reduce visual noise and confounds, we ap-
plied a consistent negative prompt for all genera-
tions to avoid low quality or undesired attributes:
poor quality, low resolution,
bad anatomy, worst quality,
disfigured, different pose,
different background, colored
clothes, any color except white
A.4 Step 4: Controlling Gender and Race
After creating the seed image, the seed
image is then passed to the Stable Dif-
fusion XL Image-to-Image pipeline
(stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 )
with strength parameter of 0.7. To generate the
remaining 11 race-gender combinations in the
Cartesian product {Asian, Black, Indian, Latino,
Middle Eastern, White} ×{man, woman},
we applied the pipeline for 11 times, exceptFigure 2: Process of Image Generation in BASIC
for Asian male images. Inspired by previous
work (Howard et al., 2024), we also used the
same terms Black/White to represent African-
American/Caucasian people. This yields 12
white-clothing images per occupation.
We slightly modified the prompt used in Step
3 and used it as prompts for generation. We re-
placed ‘Asian’ and ‘man’ with placeholders race
andgender , as follows:
{race} {gender} ,{profession prompt} ,
wearing pure white clothes,
gray background, professional
photography, high detail, high
quality
We used the same negative prompts to reduce
visual noise and confounds, as in Step 3.
A.5 Step 5: Controlling Color
Each of the 12 white images is then converted to
blue and red images. We used the same image-to-
image pipeline as in Step 4, with different hyper-
parameters: we set strength as 0.8 and guidance
as 11. Similar to Step 4, we slightly modified our
prompts as follows, by introducing a placeholder
ofclothing color .
{race} {gender} , {profession
prompt} , wearing {clothing color} ,
gray background, professional
photography, high detail, high
quality
Also, as color-aware negative prompts can pre-
vent leakage into unwanted colors, we modified
negative prompts as follows:poor quality, low resolution,
bad anatomy, worst quality,
disfigured, different pose,
different background, colored
clothes, any color except {target
color}
A.6 Step 6: Filtering
As a result, we obtain 36 images per occupation
and its scene (or action). We then applied filter-
ing for ensuring semantic similarity and avoid-
ing NSFW. For both filtering, we used CLIP
(openai/clip-vit-base-patch32 ).
B Experimental Setup
We called eight LVLMs with following meth-
ods. For Llama, Qwen, and Pixtral models,
we used OpenRouter API5for generating re-
sponses. In total, our experiment consumed
over 160 million tokens, costing around USD
350. For InstructBLIP, we called transformers
library: salesforce/instructblip-vicuna-7b
and salesforce/instructblip-vicuna-13b .
All experiments were conducted in a Python
3.10.16 environment with diffusers 0.25.1,
transformers 4.49.0, scipy 1.15.1, and torch
2.1.2.
Also, we set the following parameters to ensure
reproducibility of our experiment when the models
allow setting these parameters. For temperature,
we used 0 for deterministic response. For maximun
number of tokens in generation, we used 1024.

C Detailed Result on race
VADER: Stereotype levels were found to differ
significantly across race. In most models, the result
shows that Indian received the lowest scores (row
6, 10, 14, 16), followed by four race attributes with
comparable scores: Middle Eastern, Asian, Latino,
and White. Black consistently scored the highest
(row 5, 10-13). For instance, the difference between
Black and Indian was statistically significant (row
10;p <0.05except for Qwen 7B)
Competence: Regarding race, we observed a
higher frequency of competence-related stereo-
types compared to V ADER. Moreover, stereotype
levels differed significantly across race. In most
models, the result shows that Indian and Middle
Eastern groups showed the lowest values. Latino,
Black and White showed higher score than those
two. Lastly, Asian received the highest or compa-
rable scores to White. For instance, Asian showed
higher competence than Indian (row 10; p <0.001
except for Qwen 7B) and Middle Eastern (row 19;
p <0.001for all). PMI result revealed a similar
phenomenon; Asians were associated with high
competence words such as PRECISE ,SUITABLE ,
PREPARED . Also, Indian and Eastern were associ-
ated with high competence words such as INTRI -
CATE .C.1 Warmth
Warmth: Regarding Race, we observed a higher
frequency of stereotypes in warmth compared to
V ADER. Moreover, stereotype levels differed sig-
nificantly across race. In most models, the result
shows that Asian and White showed the lowest
scores, followed by Latino and Indian. Black and
Middle Eastern received the highest scores. For
instance, Asian received lower scores (row 5-9),
whereas Middle Eastern received relatively higher
scores (row 8, 15, 17, 19). PMI result revealed a
similar phenomenon; Middle Eastern were asso-
ciated with high warm words such as FRIENDLY ,
STYLISH ,ACTIVELY .
