ABSTRACT: This paper presents an intelligent work automation approach in the context of contemporary digital 
transformation by integrating generative AI and Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) technologies with a n 
Automation Agent to realize E nd-to-End (E2E) automation of corporate financial expense processing tasks. While 
tradit ional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective for repetitive, rule -based simple task automation, 
it faces limitations in handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision -making. This study 
designs and implements a four -stage integrated process comprising automatic recognition of supporting documents 
such as receipts via OCR/IDP, item classification based on a policy -driven database, intelligent exception handling 
supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), a nd human -in-the-loop final decision -making with 
continuous system learning through an Automation Agent. Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the 
system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in processing time for pape r receipt expense 
tasks, decreased error rates, and improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy and 
consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data -driven decision support. Furthermore, the system embodies a 
virtuo us cycle by learning from human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling capabilities. 
Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents 
effectively overcomes the limitation s of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex corporate 
processes. The study also discusses potential extensions to other domains such as accounting, human resources, and 
procurement, and proposes future directions for AI -driven hyper -automation development.

1 Introduction  
The acceleration of digital transformation has led companies to expand their interest and investment 
in automating business processes to secure a competitive edge and achieve sustainable growth. In particular, 
the automation of repetitive and time -consuming office tasks is recognized as a key factor directly 
influencing productivity improve ment and cost reduction. Initially, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) was 
primarily used to automate rule -based repetitive tasks [ 1], but recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) technology, particularly generative A I and Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), have overcome the 
limitations of RPA and opened possibilities for automating more complex and intelligent tasks. Generative 
AI, which can create new content such as text, images, audio, and video based on extens ive training data, 
has enabled users to easily utilize generative AI services [ 2, 3]. Specifically, generative AI chatbots have 
reached the level of analyzing human emotions and intentions to prov ide responses [ 4], and with the advent 
of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been significant improvements in automated conversation 
generation and translation [ 5]. However, generative AI ca n also generate responses conflicting with the 
latest information and may have a lower understanding of new problems or domains due to relying on  
 
previously learned content [ 6]. To address this, solutions such as domain -specif ic fine -tuning of LLMs and 
using internal information to enhance reliability through methods like RAG are being explored [ 7]. IDP 
goes beyond Optical Character Recognition (OCR) by understanding the structure and context of 
documents to accurately extract and classify necessary information [ 8]. Additionally, IDP is faster, cheaper, 
and more accurate than humans reading documents and inputting data [ 9]. These technologi cal 
advancements are providing new opportunities for automating business processes in companies. 
Furthermore, the growth of the IDP market is driven by the increasing adoption of intelligent automation 
technologies to enhance productivity and efficiency ac ross organizations. Core functions such as marketing, 
human resources, finance, and analytics are leveraging IDP software to automate tasks like insight 
generation, document scanning, and candidate selection, thereby reducing workloads. This allows 
organiz ations to minimize repetitive and manual document processing tasks and focus on more strategic 
and value -added activities [ 10]. In particular, in corporate accounting tasks, generative AI contributes to 
improving efficiency an d accuracy through automation and data analysis [ 11]. Among accounting tasks, 
financial expense processing is a representative repetitive business process that all organizations face. 
However, many companies still rely on inef ficient methods such as manual processing and paper receipts 
for expense management. Manual expense management is prone to human errors, and complex processes 
like organizing paper receipts, filling out forms  
The main reason for the delay in financial acco unting tasks is the manual verification and review 
process for expense processing, which necessitates the introduction of automation to address this issue [ 9]. 
Many companies are actively seeking solutions to improve the effic iency of their expense processing 
processes to resolve such inefficiencies.  
This study aims to address these issues by proposing a solution that combines generative AI and 
OCR/IDP technologies with Automation Agents to achieve End -to-End (E2E) automation f or corporate 
expense management processes. Through real -world implementation cases, it seeks to validate the 
effectiveness and potential of this approach. This goes beyond the automation of simple repetitive tasks, as 
the system intelligently handles and l earns from exception situations that require human judgment, marking 
a significant step toward true Hyperautomation.  
The main objectives of this study are as follows: First, to understand the concepts and characteristics 
of generative AI, OCR/IDP, and Automation Agent technologies, and theoretically explore how these 
technologies can contribute to the automation of complex business processes, such as financial expense 
management, when combined. Second, to conduct an in -depth analysis of actual cases whe re end -to-end 
automation was implemented in financial expense management tasks using Automation Agent solutions. 
Third, to compare the quantitative and qualitative effects before and after the introduction of the proposed 
automation system, and through thi s, to evaluate the impact of generative AI and OCR/IDP -based 
Automation Agents on improving corporate productivity and enhancing operational efficiency.  
This study is structured as follows. Chapter 1, the Introduction, presents the background and necessity  
of the research, as well as its objectives and scope. Chapter 2 examines the concepts and technological 
trends of generative AI, OCR/IDP, RPA, and Automation Agents, as well as E2E automation, and analyzes 
the characteristics of corporate expense processi ng tasks and the limitations of existing automation methods. 
Chapter 3 focuses on the automation of corporate expense processing using Automation Agents, detailing 
the problems of existing processes, the background and goals of introducing the automation s ystem, and 
the four -stage automation implementation process from document recognition to user judgment reflection. 
Chapter 4 analyzes the quantitative and qualitative effects observed in actual cases, discusses the limitations 
encountered during implementa tion, and proposes future improvement plans. Chapter 5 summarizes the 
research findings, presents the implications and contributions of the study, and suggests directions for future 
related research.

2 Literature Review  
2.1 Generative AI  
Figures Generati ve AI (Gen AI) is a field of artificial intelligence that can generate new and original 
content by learning existing data [ 2, 12]. It can create various forms of data, such as text, images, audio,  and 
video, and has shown remarkable achievements in recent years, particularly with advancements in deep 
learning technologies, especially the Transformer architecture and LLMs [ 13]. Generative AI distinguishes 
itself from An alytic AI, which merely recognizes patterns and classifies data, by producing creative outputs.  
The core technology of generative AI is learning the fundamental patterns and structures of data based 
on large datasets [ 14]. For  example, LLMs learn vast amounts of text data to understand grammar, vocabulary, 
context, and even specific styles, enabling them to generate new sentences, answer questions, or summarize 
text. These capabilities hold potential for various applications in  corporate environments, such as customer 
service chatbots, automated content marketing material generation, and support for software code 
development. As a result, companies are seeking ways to automate diverse work processes —such as code 
writing, RAG -based search, and image processing —using AI, with increasing demand to enhance 
productivity and efficiency [ 15]. 
Additionally, by utilizing LLM, it is possible to address the limitations of systems that rely solely on 
OCR for doc ument digitization, such as the difficulty OCR faces in misrecognizing characters [ 16]. 
Accordingly, in complex tasks such as financial expense processing automation, which involves intricate 
rules and exceptions, generative A I can play a role in understanding user intent through natural language -
based question -and-answer interactions, comprehending policy documents, and providing appropriate 
judgments. For instance, when account classification for a new item is required, gener ative AI can recommend 
the most suitable account based on existing data and policies or assist in determining whether the item aligns 
with company policies. This presents new possibilities for solving non -standard and context -dependent 
problems that were c hallenging for traditional rule -based automation systems.  
When examining technological trends, generative AI is evolving to produce increasingly sophisticated 
and human -like outputs as the scale of models grows and the quantity and quality of training data  improve 
[13]. Additionally, research on small -scale models (Small Language Models, SLMs) tailored to specific 
domains or tasks is actively underway, enabling the development of AI solutions optimized for particular 
industries  or corporate environments. Furthermore, just as humans acquire and understand information 
through various senses such as sight, hearing, and touch, multimodal AI systems can process and comprehend 
multiple forms of data —such as text, images, audio, and vi deo—simultaneously [ 17]. With the advancement 
of multimodal AI, methodologies for implementing multimodal LLM -based Multi -Agent Systems (MAS) 
and effectively integrating AI technologies into business processes are being propos ed. However, the use of 
generative AI comes with ethical and technical challenges, including issues related to the factuality of 
generated content, bias, copyright, and potential misuse. Therefore, a cautious approach and continuous 
research are necessary to address these concerns [ 13]. 
2.2 Document Understanding Technology  
Document Understanding is a technology that automatically extracts, classifies, and verifies text and data 
from various types of documents (paper, images, P DFs, etc.), converts them into digital data, and automates 
business processes. OCR and IDP play a key role in this process. Recently, it has been categorized into AI 
OCR, which adds AI capabilities to traditional OCR, and IDP, which enables intelligent do cument processing, 
as shown in Fig. 1. IDP and OCR are complementary to each other. OCR provides the technical foundation 
for extracting text from document images, while IDP builds a comprehensive system that understands the 
meaning of documents based on OC R results, extracts necessary information, and utilizes it in business 
processes. Therefore, OCR plays a critical role in the data collection stage of IDP, and IDP implements the 
automation and intelligence of document processing by leveraging various AI t echnologies, including OCR.   
 
 
Figure 1:  Document Understanding Concept Diagram  
2.2.1 Optical Character Recognition (OCR)  
OCR is a method for extracting text from scanned documents and images [ 18]. CR is an optical 
character recognition technology that first detects character areas in images or documents through the 
character detection stage, and then performs the character recognition stage for those areas [ 19]. Generally, 
the OCR process is divi ded into image preprocessing, text segmentation/localization, feature extraction, 
text recognition, and post -processing [ 20]. Through this, OCR technology can automatically extract text 
from images or scanned documents and con vert it into editable digital data. Early OCR technologies 
primarily demonstrated high recognition rates for standardized fonts and clean background documents. 
However, due to factors such as diverse fonts, handwriting, complex layouts, and degraded image quality, 
their application in real -world work environments was limited. Nevertheless, with the recent advancements 
in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning -based image recognition technologies, the accuracy and 
scope of OCR have significantly  improved [ 19]. The latest OCR engines support various languages and 
characters, providing relatively high -level text extraction performance even in low -resolution images or 
distorted documents.  
2.2.2 Intelligent Document Proc essing (IDP)  
IDP is a concept that takes OCR technology to the next level. Unlike traditional OCR, which only 
extracts text, IDP goes beyond by automatically classifying documents (e.g., invoices, contracts, receipts), 
identifying specific fields within th e document (e.g., vendor name, amount, date, items), extracting them as 
structured data, and validating the accuracy of the extracted information. This enables more intelligent 
document understanding and processing capabilities.  
IDP solutions utilize a com bination of various AI technologies, such as machine learning (ML), natural 
language processing (NLP), and computer vision, to accurately extract key information from unstructured 
or semi -structured documents and integrate it with enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, etc.) to automate 
subsequent business processes [8]. In particular, understanding document images [9] is a critical yet 
challenging task that requires complex capabilities such as text reading and comprehensive document 
comprehension [21]. However, re cently, generative AI technologies have been integrated into IDP systems, 
where LLMs are used to understand document meanings, perform context -based data extraction and 
classification tasks. For example, when extracting information such as purchase items, amounts, and dates 
from receipt images, LLMs contribute to identifying accurate information by considering the context. 
Additionally, LLMs are utilized in tasks such as automatically summarizing or classifying extracted data, 
enhancing the intelligence and  efficiency of IDP systems. IDP technology continues to evolve, and recently, 
it has been provided in the form of cloud -based services, which reduce initial implementation costs and 
increase scalability. Furthermore, 'zero -shot' or 'few -shot' learning tech niques have been applied, enabling 
learning for specific document types with only a small number of sample documents, thereby providing 
flexibility to quickly respond to new types of documents [1, 22]. These technological advancements are 
playing a crucial  role in expanding the scope of automation in document -intensive fields such as finance, 
accounting, law, and human resources.

In financial expense management tasks, OCR/IDP technology is used to perform automation. The 
receipts, invoices, and transaction statements submitted by employees are highly diverse in form and format, 
and are mostly composed of unstructured data. Previously, financial personnel had to manually review these 
documents and input the necessary information into the system. However, with the introduction of IDP, 
this process  can now be automated. For example, when a user uploads a corporate card receipt image to the 
system, the IDP solution automatically recognizes and extracts information such as the company name, 
business registration number, transaction date, supply amount , tax amount, total amount, approval number, 
and individual purchase item names, quantities, and unit prices from the image. In the Automation Agent 
case study of this research, IDP was utilized as the core technology in the first stage of the "document 
recognition" process, where it extracted text such as item names, amounts, and dates from receipt images 
and converted them into usable data. Notably, IDP's ability to go beyond simple OCR by understanding 
context and accurately classifying items significant ly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of subsequent 
automation stages.  
2.3 RPA and Automation Agent  
RPA is a technology that algorithmizes simple and repetitive tasks to automate them through software, 
enabling them to be performed in place of humans [ 23]. It is also a method of automating tasks that users 
perform repeatedly and simply on computers by allowing software to execute them instead [ 24]. In this way, 
RPA is a technology that automates tasks, meaning the automation of service tasks performed by humans [ 25]. 
Additionally, RPA automation complements people by performing all or part of the functions previously 
performed by humans to achieve work goals [ 26]. RPA primarily mimics user interface (UI) interactions to 
operate existing applications (e.g., ERP, CRM, websites, Excel), allowing for rapid automation without 
system changes, which is one of its advantages [ 1]. Initially, RPA was mainly applied to simple tasks based 
on clear rules and structured data, such as data entry, file transfer, email processing, and report generation. 
Through the introduction of RPA, companies could expect benefits such as im proved work processing speed, 
reduced errors, cost savings, and employees' focus on high -value -added tasks [ 1]. 
However, traditional RPA had several limitations. First, it struggled with unstructured data processing. 
It lacked  the ability to understand and process various forms of unstructured data, such as images, natural 
language text, and scanned documents, making it difficult to apply to tasks involving such data. Second, it 
was inflexible in handling exceptions. When excep tions occurred outside of predefined rules, RPA bots often 
halted their tasks or generated errors, frequently requiring human intervention. Third, it had limitations in  
 
complex decision -making. It was challenging to implement decision -making logic that req uired consideration 
of multiple variables or human judgment [ 1]. 
To overcome these limitations, the concept of Intelligent Automation or Hyperautomation has emerged. 
The main technologies applied in Hyperautomation include cog nitive and execution technologies that 
recognize, execute, and make decisions about tasks and processes to be automated, enabling optimal 
automation [ 19]. Achieving Hyperautomation requires providing services in a more automat ed manner to 
increase speed, reduce errors, and deliver them more consistently [ 27]. The goal is to expand the scope of 
automation and infuse intelligence by combining process automation technologies such as RPA with various 
technologies like AI, ML, NLP, and IDP. In the field of process automation, next -generation AI -based agents 
capable of executing complex tasks have emerged, with Automation Agents playing a crucial role [ 28]. 
Automation Agents are no longer just simple task performers; they are intelligent software robots that can 
recognize more complex situations, analyze data, interact with users, and even improve their performance 
through learning by integrating AI technologies.  
The Automatio n Agent serves as both an interface and an executor, enabling corporate financial 
managers to comprehensively review and make final decisions on information extracted by IDP, database 
comparison results, and Gen AI recommendations. Notably, it plays a pivo tal role in implementing a Human -
in-the-loop1 mechanism by automatically reflecting financial managers' judgments (e.g., approving account 
classifications for new items) into the system. This allows the system to learn and make decisions 
autonomously in si milar cases in the future. By involving humans to handle exceptions and enabling the 
system to learn from these outcomes, it creates a virtuous cycle that continuously enhances the intelligence 
and adaptability of the automation system. Ultimately, modern RPA is evolving beyond simple rule -based 
automation, leveraging AI -powered Automation Agents to collaborate with humans and adapt flexibly to 
complex and dynamic work environments. This evolution is essential for achieving E2E automation in areas 
such as c orporate expense management, where exceptions are frequent and human judgment is critical.  
2.4 E2E (End -to-End) Automation  
RPA E2E automation refers to the process of automating an entire workflow from start to finish with 
minimal or no human intervention.  It moves beyond fragmented approaches that only automate individual 
tasks or specific segments, aiming instead to integrate and optimize the overall workflow by seamlessly 
connecting multiple systems, departments, and diverse technological elements. Addit ionally, it is advisable to 
select processes that can be completed within 1 to 2 weeks as the target for E2E task handling, as this duration 
is manageable for monitoring and oversight on the platform. If the process becomes too lengthy, it may require 
continuous monitoring and management until completion, which could hinder rather than enhance automation 
efficiency [19].  
E2E automation goes beyond simply replacing repetitive tasks, focusing on supporting data -driven 
decision -making, flexibly addressing exce ptions, and ultimately maximizing business value [1].  
Traditional task automation has primarily been carried out at the task level. For example, individual tasks 
such as data entry, report generation, and data synchronization between systems could be relat ively easily 
automated using tools like RPA. However, in reality, most corporate business processes are complex, 
involving multiple stages, various systems, and numerous stakeholders. In such an environment, fragmented 
automation has limitations in resolvi ng bottlenecks in the entire process or achieving significant efficiency 
improvements. Instead, it often led to new inefficiencies due to the disconnect between automated and 
manually processed parts.  
 
                                                           
1 The term human -in-the-loop (HITL) generally refers to the need for human interaction, intervention, and judgment to control or 
change the outcome of a process  [29].  7 
 
E2E automation is a concept that emerged to overcome t hese limitations, holding significance as shown 
in Table 2.  
Table 2: Benefits of E2E Automation  
Classification  Description  
Enhanced Process Visibility 
and Control  Monitor and manage the entire process from the beginning to the end of operations to 
identify and improve bottlenecks or inefficiencies, ensuring compliance with 
regulations and risk management.  
Maximizing Operational 
Efficiency  Minimize manual work and seamlessly connect data flow between multiple systems to 
reduce overall processing time and operational costs, contributing to improved 
productivity [ 1]. 
Data -Driven Decision 
Support  Collect and analy ze data generated throughout the process to enable decision -making 
based on objective indicators.  
Enhancing Customer and 
Employee Experience  As the speed and accuracy of task processing improve, customer satisfaction increases, 
and employees can focus on more creative and strategic tasks, freeing them from 
repetitive and low -value work.  
 
The automation of the 'E2E Financial Expense Processing' process using the Automation Agent is a 
prime example of the importance of E2E automation. From attaching receipt s to extracting information 
through IDP, policy -based classification, exception handling using AI Flow, and final review and system 
learning through the Automation Agent, the entire process of financial expense processing is seamlessly 
connected and automa ted. This goes beyond replacing repetitive tasks to effectively implement complex 
scenarios that require human judgment. In this way, E2E automation plays a key role in enabling companies 
to achieve true digital transformation and enhance their competitive ness.  
2.5 An Examination of Corporate Financial Expense Management Tasks  
The task of managing corporate financial expenses is a universal and essential administrative task that 
occurs in all organizations, regardless of their size or industry. It involves the process of reimbursing and 
paying expenses incurred by employees in relation to their work (e.g., transportation costs, meal expenses, 
purchase of supplies, travel expenses, etc.) in accordance with the company's regulations and procedures. The 
task of  managing expenses has the following key characteristics.  
First, handling various proof documents: The most basic step in financial expense processing is collecting 
and reviewing documents that prove expenditures, such as receipts, tax invoices, transactio n statements, and 
business trip requisition forms. These proof documents vary greatly in form (paper, electronic), format, and 
the type and level of information they contain. In particular, receipts often consist of a mix of unstructured 
text and images.  
Second, compliance with internal regulations and policies: Each company has its own regulations and 
policies related to expense processing (e.g., allowable/prohibited items, limits, account classification criteria, 
etc.), and all expense processing must str ictly adhere to these regulations. This goes beyond mere amount 
verification and includes a process of determining whether the purpose and content of the expenditure align 
with the company’s policies.  
Third, frequent occurrence of exceptional situations: I n the financial expense processing process, various 
exceptional situations can occur. For example, cases where the content of a receipt does not match the actual 
purchased item, where a new item does not clearly fall under the existing account classificati on criteria due 
to the introduction of a new item, or where there are typos or information omissions are common. For instance,  
 
when receipts classified as consumables include items like coffee or snacks, such issues that cannot be 
resolved through simple a utomatic classification may frequently and continuously arise.  
Fourth, multi -stakeholder involvement and approval process: Multiple stakeholders, including the 
expense applicant, department head, financial officer, and final approver, are involved in the e xpense 
processing procedure. Each step requires review and approval, ensuring transparency and accuracy in task 
execution. However, this process can also become a factor that delays overall processing time.  
Fifth, requirement for data accuracy and audit tr aceability: Financial data serves as the foundation for a 
company's accounting processes and tax filings, thus requiring a high level of accuracy. Additionally, all 
processing procedures must be clearly recorded and traceable for potential audits.  
Due to t hese characteristics, traditional manual -based financial expense processing required significant 
time and effort, and was prone to human errors. To address this, some companies attempted to introduce RPA 
to automate repetitive tasks such as data entry and information transfer between systems. However, traditional 
RPA faced challenges in achieving full automation of financial expense processing due to limitations such as 
those outlined in Table 3 [ 1]. 
Table 3: Limitations of Tra ditional RPA  
Limit  Description  
Limitations in the Processing 
of Unstructured Evidence 
Materials  Limitations in accurately recognizing and extracting necessary information from 
unstructured documents such as receipts [ 8]. 
Inability to respond to 
exceptional situations  Rule -based RPA struggles to handle unexpected situations that are not predefined [ 1]. 
Complexity in Judgment and 
Decision -Making  The appropriateness of expense items, classification of account subjects, and review of 
policy violations require human cognitive judgment, making them difficult to 
automate.  
Bottlenecks caused by 
partial automation  When only a portion of the entire process is automated, the lack of smooth integration 
between the automated and manual segments can lead to the emergence of new 
bottlenecks or impact the overall improvement in efficiency.  
 
In conclusion, due to the complexity, diversity, and frequent exceptions in corporate financial expense 
management, it has been challenging to implement effective E2E automation using only traditional simple 
automation technologies. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to achieve accurate receipt 
recognition through OCR/IDP, utilize intelligent techn ologies such as generative AI for exception handling 
and decision support, and establish a human -AI collaboration environment through Automation Agents.  
The case studied in this research presents a new approach that goes beyond the limitations of existing 
automation by integratively utilizing these technologies.  
3 Case Study: Automating Financial Expense Processing Using Automation Agent  
In this chapter, based on the theoretical background discussed earlier, we present a case study of 
successfully implement ing E2E automation for financial expense processing tasks in an actual corporate 
environment by utilizing generative AI and OCR/IDP -based Automation Agents.  
The subject of this study, Company S, is a major domestic corporation operating various business 
divisions and overseas branches, requiring the processing of a large number of corporate card receipts on a 
monthly basis. Expense management is a critical process for financial management and compliance with  9 
 
regulations at S, but the existing manual -based p rocessing method was fraught with several issues. 
Therefore, this chapter aims to present the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed 
technology integration by detailing the problems of the existing process, the background and objectives of 
introducing an automation system, and the specific four -stage implementation process.  
3.1 Technical Approach and Implementation Plan  
In this section, we will describe in detail the technical approach and implementation of the end -to-end 
automation syste m for financial expense processing using Automation Agent, as well as the integration plan 
for its key components. The financial expense processing automation based on Automation Agent proceeds 
in four stages, as shown in Fig. 2. The discussion focuses on the system architecture supporting this four -stage 
automation process, the core technologies such as generative AI, OCR/IDP, and the integration mechanism 
of Automation Agent, and the overall flow of data.  
 
Figure 2: Business Automation Process Based on IDP and Automation Agent  
3.1.1 Overview of Automation Agent Application  
Today, companies are moving beyond the automation of simple repetitive tasks to pursue flexible 
automation that considers exceptional situations, i.e., E2E automation combined with hum an judgment. 
However, building an automated environment that can flexibly incorporate human judgment in complex 
and diverse exceptional situations is a challenging task. To address this issue, this study applied Brity 
Automatio n2, an automation -focused Automation Agent, to automate the financial expense processing tasks 
of a company, rather than directly developing a program source code.  
The main reasons for applying Brity Automation are as follows.  
 Increased demand for intelligent automation:  Beyond the  limitations of simple RPA, there is a 
growing need for intelligent automation solutions that can implement complex end -to-end scenarios 
by leveraging Gen AI, IDP, and BPA (Business Process Automation).  
 Improving Work Efficiency and Maximizing Productivity : To alleviate the workload of 
financial personnel and enable them to focus on more valuable tasks, we aimed to address 
inefficiencies in financial expense processing, which accounted for an average of 1,450 cases per

month and took more than 24 hours to c omplete.  
 Enhancing Support for Partners and Customers:  It was necessary to create and provide use 
cases to help customers who had adopted RPA expand their automation areas and reduce trial and 
error for partners when applying new features of Brity Automati on. 
The goal of financial expense automation using Brity Automation has been set as follows under this 
background.  
 Implementing End -to-End Automation:  From receipt submission to final processing and system 
learning, the entire financial expense process is integrated and automated.  
 Exception Handling Intelligence:  Implement intelligent judgment support for new items and 
ambiguous cases through accurate information extraction using IDP and AI Flo w3 (LLM 
integration).  
 Establishing a Human -AI Collaboration Envi ronment:  Through the Automation Agent, finance 
professionals review AI suggestions and make final decisions, and the system learns from these 
outcomes to continuously improve its automation performance, establishing a Human -in-the-Loop 
mechanism.  
 Flexibili ty and Scalability:  Establish a foundation to respond flexibly to various exceptional 
situations and to expand the automation model to other business areas such as accounting, human 
resources, and procurement in the future.  
In this paper, through the case of automating the "financial expense processing" business process, which is 
routine yet frequently involves exceptional situations, using Brity Automation, we aim to explore the extent 
to which the scope of automation can be expanded. Through this case stu dy, we suggest that it holds significant 
importance in exploring the potential of intelligent automation.  
3.1.2 Integration of Main Technologies Used  
The core of this system lies in the effective integration of three major technologies: OCR/IDP, AI Flow 
leveraging generative AI, and Automation Agent. The integration approach for each technology is as 
follows.  
 Integration of OCR/IDP with Workflow Engine:  When a user uploads a receipt, the w
orkflow engine sends the image to the OCR/IDP module. The IDP module processes the imag
e and returns the extracted structured data in JSON or XML format to the workflow engine. T
his data is used as input for subsequent processing steps (policy -based classification, AI Flow i
nvocation, etc.). Brity Automation can integrate e xternal IDP solutions via API calls or utilize t
                                                           
3 Brity Automation's Langflow -based AI workflow builder lets you easily connect AI components like LLMs, data sources, and 
prompts to design complex applications.   11 
 
he integrated IDP functionality within the platform.  
 Policy -Based Classification Engine and AI Flow Integration with Gen AI:  When item 
information extracted through IDP is not clearly classified by the policy -based classificatio
n engine (not found in the whitelist/blacklist) or requires additional judgment, the workflo
w engine calls the AI Flow module. AI Flow sends the item in formation along with a pr
edefined prompt (e.g., "Which account should this item be classified under according to t
he company's expense processing policy, and is it permissible? What is the basis for this?
") to the generative AI model (LLM) API. The LLM gen erates a response based on its l
earned knowledge and provided company policy documents, which is then returned to the 
AI Flow module. During this process, the LLM may also utilize web search functionality 
to reference up -to-date information or external con text. 
 Integration of AI Flow ( LLM Interface) and Automation Agent:  Recommendations gen
erated by AI Flow (LLM) regarding account compliance, policy alignment, and justificatio
n are presented to the finance team through the Automation Agent interface, along with o
ther information (IDP extraction results, policy DB comparison results). Based on this inf
ormation, the finance team makes the final decision, and if necessary, they can modify th
e recommendations or input additional details.  
 Integration of Automatio n Agent with Backend Systems (DB, Orchestrator):  The final 
decisions made by the finance team through the Automation Agent (approval, rejection, m
odified information, new learning data, etc.) are recorded and updated in the relevant data
bases (policy DB, p rocessing history DB, etc.) via the orchestrator. If classification criteri
a for new items are finalized, they are reflected as whitelist/blacklist or AI model learnin
g data, enhancing the system's intelligence. Additionally, the final processing results a re tr
ansmitted to ERP or accounting systems via APIs, enabling automatic subsequent accounti
ng processes.  
Such technological integration is implemented in a loosely coupled manner based on APIs, enabling 
independent upgrades or replacements of individual t echnical components and enhancing the overall 
flexibility of the system.  
3.1.3 Data collection, processing, analysis, and reflection flow  
The data flow in the E2E automation system for financial expense processing follows a cyclical lifecycle 
as follows.  
1. Data Collection:  
 When a user submits an expense request, they input related information (such as 
purpose of use, amount, etc.) along with the receipt image (unstructured data) into
 the system.  
 The system collects uploaded receipt images as the primary inpu t data.   
 
2. Data Processing:  
 1-Stage Process (IDP):  The collected receipt images are sent to the OCR/IDP mo
dule, where they undergo text extraction and key field identification processes to 
be converted into structured data (item name, amount, date, etc.).  
 2-Stage Process (Policy -Based Classification):  The transformed structured data is 
compared with the database based on the policies of the predefined financial acco
unts set within the Brity Automation Orchestrator, and is initially automatically cla
ssified acc ording to predefined rules (e.g., allow/block, account recommendations, e
tc.). 
3. Data Analysis & Decision Support:  
 3-Stage Process (AI Flow):  When exceptions (unclassified or ambiguous items) o
ccur during the first classification, the data is forwarded to th e AI Flow module. 
AI Flow utilizes Gen AI (LLM) to comprehensively analyze company policy docu
ments, past processing cases, and, if necessary, external web information to genera
te recommendations for the account, policy compliance status, and the basis for  ju
dgment.  
4. User Review & Final Decision  
 4-Stage (Automation Agent):  The extraction results from the IDP, policy -based cl
assification results, and analysis and recommendations from AI Flow are integrated
ly provided to the finance team through the Automation  Agent interface. The fina
nce team reviews these and makes a final decision to approve, reject, or modify.  
5. Data Reflection & System Learning:  
 The final decision of the finance officer is immediately reflected in the system. A
pproved expenses are transferre d to the subsequent payment processing procedure, 
and related information can be integrated into the accounting system.  
 Especially important is that the results of the responsible person’s judgment (e.g., 
classification of new items, updated information) a re fed back and stored as learni
ng data for the policy database or AI model within the Brity Automation Orchestr
ator. Through this, the system continuously learns, improves its ability to automati
cally handle exceptions over time, and evolves in a directio n that minimizes huma
n intervention (Self -learning & Improvement).  
This cyclical flow of data goes beyond simple one -time automation, serving as the core mechanism 
for implementing a learning -based automation system that continuously accumulates intelligence and 
improves performance. This maximizes the long -term effectiveness of E2E automation and provides a 
foundation for adapting flexibly to changing business environments.   13 
 
 
3.1.4 Data collection, processing, analysis, and reflection flow  
The fin ancial expense processing E2E automation system proposed in this study is based on the Brity 
Automation platform and is composed of multiple modules and technical elements integrated organically. 
The overall system architecture can be divided into four mai n layers: the data input layer, the intelligent 
processing layer, the user interaction and learning layer, and the backend infrastructure layer, as shown in 
Fig. 3.   
 
Figure 3: E2E Automation System Architecture  
1. Data Input Layer:  
 User Interface: A web or mobile interface is provided for employees to upload receipt 
images (scanned or photographed) along with expense reports. This can be implemented 
through integration with Brity Automation's user portal or an existing groupware system.  
 Support for Multiple Input Channels: Flexibility to collect evidence materials through 
various channels such as email attachments, direct capture via mobile apps, and more.  
2. Intelligent Processing Layer (IPL):  
 OCR/IDP Module:  Extracts text from uploaded receipt images and ident ifies key fields 
(business name, amount, date, items, etc.) to convert them into structured data. It integrates 
external or open -source IDP solutions in library form and enhances the accuracy of item 
classification through contextual understanding.  
 Policy -based Classification Engine:  Built within the Brity Automation Orchestrator, it 
performs initial automatic classification based on item information extracted through IDP, 
referencing an internal database (whitelist/blacklist/account policy information). Th is 
database reflects the company's expense processing regulations and policies. When using 
LLM, this can be addressed through prompts, which are detailed and customized to 
describe the expert identity of each agent, including profile, objectives, and const raints [31]. 
 AI Flow Module (Gen AI Integration):  When exceptions (new items, ambiguous entries, 
etc.) that were not handled in the first classification occur, this module integrates with 
generative AI (LLM) to provide intelligent judgment. It utilizes pre -trained company 
 
 
policy documents and external we b search results to query the LLM, deriving 
recommended accounts, policy compliance, and judgment basis. Users can also obtain 
additional information or request clarification through a natural language interface with the 
LLM.  
 Workflow Engine:  A core functi on of the Brity Automation Orchestrator, it defines the 
entire financial expense processing process from data input to final handling, and 
automates task flows, conditional branching, notifications, and more at each stage.  
3. User Interaction & Learning Layer : 
 Automation Agent Interface:  Provides an integrated dashboard that allows financial 
officers to comprehensively review AI analysis results (IDP -extracted information, policy -
based classification results, AI Flow recommendations) and make final decisions. This 
interface must be intuitive and user -friendly, designed to present all necessary information 
at a glance.  
 Human -in-the-Loop (HITL) Mechanism:  Decisions made by finance personnel through 
the Automation Agent (e.g., confirming accounts for new items, ad ding similar terms) are 
not limited to one -time processing. Instead, they are automatically fed back and stored in 
the system's knowledge base (policy DB, AI model, etc.). Through this, the system 
continuously learns and becomes capable of making more accu rate and autonomous 
judgments in the future when similar cases arise.  
4. Backend Infrastructure Layer:  
 Brity Automation Orchestrator:  Acts as the central control tower that manages, monitors, 
and executes the entire automation process. It performs functions s uch as workflow 
management, bot scheduling, database integration, API integration, security, and access 
control.  
 Database:  Stores and manages policy information (whitelist/blacklist), processing history, 
learning data, user information, etc. In this case, the Brity Automation self -orchestrator 
database is used to ensure efficient maintenance and security.  
 API Gateway:  Provides an interface for safe and efficient data integration with external 
systems (ERP, accounting systems, groupware, etc.).  
This hierarch ical architecture enables organic integration while maintaining the independence of each 
module, contributing to enhancing the system's flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.  
3.2 Business Process Analysis and Design  
Expense management is a represen tative administrative task experienced by nearly all office workers, 
involving the process of submitting a receipt after using a corporate card, followed by approval from the 
approver and the finance team, and finally being processed.   15 
 
3.2.1 Analysis of Existing Business Processes  
The entire workflow involves complex procedures such as validating the validity of expense details, 
verifying account codes, and checking prohibited items based on company policies. In particular, financial 
expense processing fa ced the following issues and limitations.  
First, high reliance on manual work and time consumption: The most time -consuming task was the 
"receipt review" process. The finance team had to manually verify various types of receipts submitted and 
manually inpu t or validate the necessary information into the system. In the case of Company S, reviewing 
approximately 1,450 receipts per month took an average of over 24 hours, which required significant human 
resources and time investment.  
Second, frequent occurrenc e of exception situations and difficulty in handling them: In the financial 
expense processing process, various exception situations occurred frequently. For example, an employee 
reported purchasing batteries under the consumables account, but the actual r eceipt included a box of coffee, 
requiring reclassification to the catering account. Additionally, when new items were introduced or there 
were typos on receipts, data consistency decreased, necessitating additional verification processes. These 
exception situations were difficult to resolve with simple automated classification and required direct 
intervention and judgment from the finance team.  
Third, the difficulty in ensuring data accuracy: Since the process relied heavily on manual work, there 
was alway s a possibility of data entry errors or omissions. Additionally, discrepancies between the user's 
intentions on the receipts and the actual purchase records occurred frequently, making it challenging to 
ensure data accuracy. This could have a negative impa ct on subsequent accounting processes and audit 
responses.  
Fourth, the limitations of existing RPA: It was difficult to flexibly respond to the complexity and 
exceptions with the existing RPA solutions, which were mainly applied to simple repetitive tasks.  To 
improve efficiency, we concluded that automation beyond simple RPA, which can reflect human judgment, 
is necessary.  
These issues increased the workload of the finance department and acted as a factor hindering overall 
corporate operational efficiency. Therefore, there was an urgent need to introduce a more intelligent E2E 
automation solution that could flexibly handle exceptions and effectively combine human judgment.  
3.2.2 E2E Automation Process Definition  
The analysis of the existing work revealed that the E2E automation process to be introduced can be 
defined in the flow shown in Fig. 4.  
 
Figure 4:  Conceptual Diagram of E2E Automation Process  
When a user registers an expense receipt, the IDP automatically extracts the necessary information from 
the receipt. Subsequently, the generative AI analyzes and verifies the expense details according to the 
 
 
company’s policies, recommends the required items for system registration, and submits them. Finally, 
after the finance manager reviews and approves the s ubmitted content, it is automatically registered in the 
ERP system.  
3.2.3 E2E Automation Process Design  
The process begins when an individual card user registers a card usage receipt through the mobile app or 
the card expense management screen. When proces sing personal expenses, the attached files are compared 
and verified against the input data and receipt content using RPA, IDP, and LLM to automate the manual 
verification process of the accounting department's account -specific responsible personnel. The e ntire 
workflow is as shown in Fig. 5.  
 
Figure 5:  E2E Expense Processing Workflow Design  
The entire processing process consists of four stages, as detailed below.  
① Mandatory Account Receipt File Transmission: The card user registers the usage receipt, 
and the expense processing system sends the approved data (description, account, 
attachment) to Brity Automation.  
② IDP Receipt Information Extraction: Brity Automation e xtracts information from the 
receipt attached to the received approval data. At this time, file formats other than PDF and 
images are converted to JPG.  
③ Reliability Verification: If the Confidence score of the extracted mandatory items is below 
50, the receipt is considered defective, and a notification is sent to the user. For payment 
data where the selected account is a routine expense, it is determined whether the detailed 
items extracted by IDP are appropriate for the description and account using LL M. 
④ Approval Decision: If the final results, account details, and attachments are appropriate, 
they are approved and sent to SAP. If not, they are rejected and sent to SAP. Additionally, 
 17 
 
based on the results processed by Brity Automation, the SAP approval p rocess is 
automatically progressed (Approval or Rejection).  
3.3 Implementation of Business Procewss  Automation  
The financial expense automation based on the Automation Agent was implemented in four stages as shown 
in Fig. 6.  
 
Figure 6:  Business Automation  Process Based on IDP and Automation Agent  
Additionally, as shown in Fig. 7 implemented in the actual Automation Agent design tool, the system 
receives user input through the Form UI, recognizes documents using the IDP/OCR module ('T_IDP'), and 
then delive rs the results through the Form UI after processing through the policy -based classification and 
exception application ('T_RULE') process.  
 
Figure 7:  Integration of each module with the Automation Agent  
3.3.1 Step 1: Document Recognition  
The first step in automation is to accurately extract the required information from the receipt image 
uploaded by the user using the IDP Module. To achieve this, Brity Automation leverages IDP technology.  
When a user submits their card usage records, they can attach a recei pt image. On a mobile app, the receipt 
can be automatically captured and attached, or on a PC screen, as shown in Fig. 8, a receipt image can be 
attached. At this time, the service can choose between OCR or IDP modules, and the document type can 
utilize pr e-trained receipt types to check or modify data extracted in advance.  
 
 
  
Figure 8:  Receipt Attachment Screen  
When using a corporate card, notifications are delivered to the user through a messenger app as shown in 
Fig. 9. The image displays the usage recei pt, and the notification message instructs the user to submit an 
expense reimbursement approval for the card usage. Upon reviewing the content, it can be confirmed that 
a payment of 9,000 won was made at ‘ 팝스토어잠실향군타워점 (Popstore Jamsil Hyanggun Tower 
Branch) ’ on March 25, 2025.  
 
Figure 9:  Receipt and Corporate Card Usage Notification  
At this point, the IDP solution analyzes the image and extracts key text information such as item name, 
amount, and transaction date. Unlike traditional OCR technology, using IDP  technology allows for 
 19 
 
understanding the context and accurately classifying items, demonstrating the intelligent information 
processing capabilities of IDP beyond simple text extraction. The extracted data is transformed into a user -
friendly format (such a s HTML or Markdown) as shown in Fig. 10 and utilized in subsequent processing 
steps. Additionally, this process is implemented in Brity Automation to easily library external IDP using a 
Drag & Drop method, enhancing user convenience.  
 
Figure 10:  IDP Modul e Design by Brity Automation  
3.3.2 Step 2: Policy -based classification  
When data is successfully extracted from a receipt through IDP, the task involves using Brity Automation’s 
‘Data Service/Database’ feature to determine whether the extracted item is allowed or prohibited according 
to the company’s policy.  
To achieve this, Brity Automation builds its own database within the orchestrator, as shown in Fig. 11, and 
pre-sets the types of authorized goods and product information for each account in an allow ed item list 
(whitelist) and prohibited items in a list (blacklist).  
For example, the whitelist may include general food and beverage items, while the blacklist may include 
inappropriate items with low relevance to work, such as gold rings or gift certific ates. Additionally, 
depending on the company's policy, accounts such as office supplies may only be allowed for consumables.  
 
 
 
Figure 11:  Policy -Based Database Configuration  
The system performs automatic filtering by comparing the extracted receipt data wi th the database as shown 
in Fig. 12. This process is stored in Brity Automation's own database, not in an external one, providing 
efficient maintenance and security.  
 
Figure 12:  Database Utilization Linked Design in Brity Automation Designer  
3.3.3 Step 3:  Handling Exceptional Situations  
Recognizing documents through IDP and initial classification based on policies alone is insufficient to 
address all situations. In particular, exceptions occur in cases of new items not registered in the existing 
database o r items with ambiguous classification criteria. This was confirmed through a purchase case of a 
beverage called ‘ 심플리블랙 (Simply Black)’ When the item is a new entry not listed in the whitelist or 
blacklist, Brity Automation's AI Flow function is activated. AI Flow, as shown in Fig. 13, queries a LLM 
based on the company's expense policy document to determine whether the item  complies with company 
policy and which account should be used for processing. For example, by asking, “Which account should 
Simply Black be processed under?” Gen AI reviews the policy document and item classification criteria, as 
 21 
 
shown in Fig. 14, and pro vides a recommended account along with the reasoning based on the results. In 
this case, the AI identifies a similar item called ‘Simply Smooth Black’ and recommends classifying it 
under a catering -related account. The role of AI is to support decision -making as a reference tool, and the 
final decision is made by a human.  
 
Figure 13:  Design of Receipt Item Classification Using AI Flow  
 
 
Figure 14:  Policy -based Prompts  
 
 
 
Fig. 15 presents a segment of policy code that, in accordance with predefined policies,  filters itemized 
contents from card payment receipts at the prompt level. The filtered information is then re -queried to a 
LLM, and the results are compared with the model’s recommendations.  
 
 
Figure 15:  Example Code for Policy Comparison Recommendation  
3.3.4 Step 4: HITL (Human In The Loop) Phase  
The final decision on the content proposed by AI is the responsibility of the financial officer, which is the 
step of automatically reflecting the user's judgment in the system. Brity Automation's messenger chan nel 
Agent provides an interface and execution environment to support the financial officer in making such final 
decisions effectively.  
Fig. 16 (a) is the financial manager's messenger channel Agent screen. Through this Agent, it is possible to 
perform quest ion-and-answer using RAG and execute RPA. Here, I can check and proceed with the task 
assigned to me, which is to confirm the card expense application agreement.

Figure 16: Messenger Channel Agent Screen . (a) The Messenger home screen where an alarm is displayed when a 
financial manager r eceives a request for agreement ; (b) New Item Addition Confirmation Screen ; 
The responsible party can comprehensively view the receipt image extracted by the generative AI through 
IDP, the comparison results with the existing database (whitelist/blacklist), and the content recommended 
by the AI Flow through LLM (account, policy compliance, basis, etc.) through the messenger channel agent 
screen using the Form UI, as shown in Fig. 1 6(b). On this screen, the fin ance manager can either accept the 
generative AI's proposal as is or, as needed, modify the item name or add similar words to improve the 
system's knowledge base.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 7: New Item Recommendation and Data Recommendation Screen  
 
Figure  18: New Item Recommendation and Data Approval Screen  
The most critical feature is that when a financial officer reviews and approves recommendation data for a 
new item, as shown in Fig. 1 7, the decision does not only affect the current case but is automatical ly 
reflected in the database within the Brity Automation Orchestrator, as shown in Fig. 1 8. This allows the 
system to autonomously perform the correct processing based on past learned judgments when similar items 
or situations occur in the future. For exam ple, if "Simply Black" is identified as a coffee beverage and 
classified under a food and beverage account, this information is registered in the system, enabling 
automatic processing the next time the same item occurs. Additionally, by storing similar wor ds together, 
the system can flexibly respond to spelling errors or subtle differences in brand names. As shown in Fig. 
 25 
 
19, by automatically incorporating user judgments, the Automation Agent effectively integrates human 
intellectual judgment into the syste m and serves as a key component of the Human -in-the-loop mechanism, 
gradually enhancing the intelligence of the automation system through continuous learning.  
 
Figure 19: HITL Process  
Through the above 4 -stage automation process, Brity Automation complete s the E2E automation of 
financial expense processing tasks. From the initial stage where users submit receipts, through information 
extraction using IDP, policy -based automatic classification, intelligent exception handling support using 
AI Flow, and final  review by financial personnel through Automation Agent, and up to system learning, 
the entire Task process for each step is integrated and executed organically within the Process Flow function 
of the Brity Automation Orchestrator, as shown in Fig. 2 0. 
 
Figure 2 0: HumanTask and Overall Workflow Integration Process Flow  
The moment of human intervention occurs only once, but that decision enables hundreds of automated 
processes, suggesting that human intellectual judgment can be effectively integrated into t he system, 
 
 
achieving sustained automation efficiency without repeated interventions. This can be considered a 
significant advancement overcoming the limitations of existing RPA, as it goes beyond the automation of 
simple repetitive tasks and extends to the  automation of even “complex processes requiring human 
intervention”.  
This case suggests the possibility of extending a similar E2E automation model to other complex 
business areas that require human judgment and exception handling, such as accounting, human resources, 
and procurement, beyond the specific domain of financial expense processing. It is expected to contribute 
to creating an environment where employees can focus on more creative and strategic tasks by maximizing 
operational efficiency throug h hyper -automation.  
4 Analysis of the Effects of Introducing Automation  
In this chapter, we analyze the effects of introducing end -to-end automation for financial expense 
processing in a generative AI and OCR/IDP -based Automation Agent system utilizing Bri ty Automation. 
The analysis is divided into quantitative and qualitative aspects. Additionally, we present potential 
limitations that may arise during the introduction process and propose future improvement plans to 
overcome these challenges and further en hance the system.  
4.1 Quantitative Effects  
The most direct effect of introducing an automation system is the improvement in work efficiency and 
cost reduction. As a result of the pilot implementation, the evaluation of 1,448 paper receipts (png , jpg, etc., 
image files) out of the total card expenses incurred over a month showed the results as shown in Tables 4 
and 5.  
Table 4: Confusion Matrix Validation Target  
Classification  Normal  Error  
Verification Target  TP   
(Agreement/Agreement ) TN   
(Rejected/Rejected)  FP   
(Rejected /Approval)  FN 
(Agreement/Rejection)  
1,448 items  1,073  133 0 242 
 
Table 5: Quantitative Evaluation Metrics  
Performance Metrics  Calculation Formula  Result  
Accuracy  (TN+TP)/(TN+FN+FP+TP) = (133+1,073)/(133+242+0+1,073)  0.83 
Precision  TP/(TP + FP)  = 1,073/(1,073 + 0)  1 
Recall  TP/(TP + FN)  = 1,073/(1,073 + 242)  0.82 
F1 Score  2 / ((1/ Precision )+(1/ Recall ))  = 2 / (1/1 + 1/0.82)  0.90 
 
An F1 score of 0.90 indicates that the model is performing well in both precision and recall, demonstrating 
a well -balanced trade -off between the two. This balance reflects a model that prioritizes both the accuracy 
of positive predictions and minimizing false negatives.  
In addition, the expected quantitative effects based on general intell igent automation adoption cases are as 
follows:  
1. Significant Reduction in Task Processing Time:  In the case of Company S, the traditional manual  27 
 
process for handling financial and expense management tasks involved an average of 
approximately 1,450 cases per  month, each requiring more than 24 hours to complete. The 
implementation of Intelligent IDP, which enables automatic information extraction, policy -based 
categorization, exception handling support through AI Flow, and an increasing automation rate via 
a learning -based Automation Agent, led to a remarkable reduction in overall processing time. The 
time required per case decreased from several minutes to just a few tens of seconds, resulting in a 
monthly time savings of over 80% to 90%. This substantial effi ciency gain allows financial 
personnel to shift their focus from repetitive administrative tasks to more analytical and strategic 
functions.  
2. Cost Reduction in Operations:  Reducing the time required to complete tasks directly leads to a 
decrease in labor costs. By minimizing the manpower allocated to specific tasks or enabling the 
same workforce to handle more tasks, it results in tangible cost savings. Additionally, it can  also 
reduce indirect costs such as those incurred from correcting errors caused by manual work, 
managing paper documents, and other related expenses.  
3. Increased processing capacity and scalability:  Automated systems can operate 24/7, allowing 
for flexible handling of increased workloads. They effectively distribute the concentrated expense 
processing tasks that occur at the end of the month or year and provide scalability to respond to 
increased workloads due to business growth without the need for addition al personnel.  
4. Error Rate Reduction:  Accurate data extraction through IDP and system -based verification 
processes can significantly reduce human errors (such as typos, omissions, etc.) that may occur 
during manual input. This enhances the accuracy of data, improving the reliability of financial 
reporting, and reduces the time and cost spent on error correction.  
5. Improving compliance rates:  The built -in policy database and AI -based validation logic ensure 
that all expense processing is consistently carried out  in accordance with predefined company 
regulations and policies. This leads to enhanced internal controls and increased ease of responding 
to audits.  
4.2 Qualitative Effects  
The introduction of E2E automation brings about a variety of qualitative benefits that positively impact 
organizational culture and work methods.  
1. Improving Work Accuracy and Consistency:  Automated processes handle tasks based on 
consistent criteria without deviations caused by subjective human judgment or individual 
conditions, thereby enhancing the overall quality and accuracy of work. In particular, as AI 
continuously improves its decision -making standards through learning, the accuracy of handling 
complex exception situations can gradually increase.  
2. Increased Employee Satisfaction and  Work Engagement:  Financial professionals move away 
from simple, repetitive receipt processing tasks and take on more advanced roles, such as reviewing  
 
AI-generated analysis results and making final decisions. This enhances job satisfaction and creates 
an environment where employees can focus on more creative and valuable work. While human 
intervention occurs only once, the judgment made enables hundreds of automations, highlighting 
the value of employee involvement in elevating the importance of their inpu t. 
3. Enhancing Data -Driven Decision Support:  The vast amount of structured expense data 
accumulated throughout the E2E automation process can provide valuable insights for various 
decision -making processes, such as cost pattern analysis, budget management, a nd strengthening 
internal controls. For instance, it can be utilized to identify trends of excessive spending in specific 
departments or categories or to detect regulatory violations at an early stage.  
4. Rapid Response to Change and Enhanced Flexibility:  Through AI Flow and Automation Agents, 
the system can quickly learn and adapt to new types of items or changes in policies. This provides 
the flexibility to respond swiftly to changes in the business environment or new regulatory 
requirements.  
4.3 Limitations  in the Introduction Process and Future Improvement Plans  
Intelligent process automation using generative AI and OCR/IDP -based automation agents can 
contribute to improving business efficiency for companies. However, there are various limitations in the 
actual implementation process. First, high costs and prolonged time may be incurred during the initial setup, 
which can be mitigated through the use of cloud -based SaaS, phased implementation strategies, and the 
utilization of pre -trained models. Second, the  performance of IDP and AI models heavily depends on the 
availability of high -quality training data, necessitating continuous accumulation of learning data through 
data augmentation techniques and the Human -in-the-loop approach. Third, since the decision -making 
process of generative AI operates as a black box, ensuring trustworthiness and explainability in judgments 
is required. This can be achieved by presenting decision -making grounds, linking relevant policies, and 
introducing XAI technologies to enhance  user acceptance. Fourth, the lack of technical acceptance among 
organizational members is a critical task in change management, requiring user education, interface 
improvements, and system design based on active participation from business units. Fifth, s ince automated 
systems handle expense data containing sensitive information, technical and managerial security measures 
such as data encryption, access control, and regular security audits are essential. Lastly, as policies and 
environments for automated t asks continuously evolve, flexible system architecture design, establishment 
of version management systems, and self -learning -based maintenance automation are necessary in the long 
term.  
By being aware of these limitations in advance and preparing appropri ate improvement measures, 
companies can increase the likelihood of successfully introducing intelligent automation systems and 
maximize their effectiveness.  
 
5 Discussion and Conclusion  
Summary and Conclusion  
This study deeply analyzed and presented a meth od for implementing end -to-end automation of financial 
expense processing tasks by combining generative AI and OCR/IDP technologies with Automation Agents, 
focusing on cases utilizing Brity Automation. The conclusions drawn from the study are as follows:   29 
 
Firstly, the existing financial expense management process had various issues for automation 
implementation, including high reliance on manual work, frequent exceptions, and difficulties in ensuring 
data accuracy. Simply using RPA was insufficient to addres s this complexity. To overcome these challenges, 
it was confirmed that accurate document recognition through IDP, intelligent exception handling and decision 
support using generative AI, and the introduction of an Automation Agent that collaborates between  humans 
and AI are essential.  
Secondly, through the case analysis of Brity Automation, it was demonstrated that a four -step approach —
‘document recognition’ utilizing IDP, ‘policy -based classification’ based on a database, ‘exceptional AI 
inquiry’ through A I Flow (LLM integration), and ‘systematic automation of user judgment’ via Automation 
Agent —can effectively implement E2E automation in financial expense processing. Notably, the Human -in-
the-loop mechanism, where the system learns from human final judgmen ts to continuously improve 
automation performance, served as a key element in intelligent automation.  
Third, the proposed automation system was found to bring not only quantitative benefits such as reduced 
processing time, cost savings, and decreased error  rates, but also various qualitative benefits such as improved 
work accuracy, increased employee satisfaction, and enhanced support for data -driven decision -making. This 
can contribute to enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the company.  
Fourt h, it emphasized the importance of recognizing the limitations and challenges in the process of 
introducing intelligent automation systems, such as initial construction costs, data quality assurance, 
explainability of AI models, change management, and secu rity, and preparing appropriate improvement 
measures accordingly.  
In conclusion, the organic integration of generative AI, OCR/IDP, databases, and automation agents 
enables successful E2E automation even in complex and exception -prone areas of work, such as financial 
expense processing. This goes beyond mere task replace ment and holds the potential to fundamentally 
transform corporate operational methods. The Brity Automation case serves as a significant empirical 
evidence demonstrating how such technological integration can lead to tangible business value.

benchmarkin g. Third, it demonstrates the possibility of expanding the scope of automation beyond simple 
repetitive tasks to areas requiring human judgment, thereby presenting the potential for the spread of 
intelligent automation to other business domains.  
Future Res earch Directions and Suggestions for Expansion  
This study has demonstrated the feasibility of end -to-end automation for financial expense processing 
tasks using generative AI and IDP -based automation agents.  
This study demonstrated the possibility of E2E a utomation of financial expense processing tasks by 
combining generative AI and OCR/IDP technologies with Brity Automation. Future research can be expanded 
in the following directions:    
 
 First, the automation framework of this study has high applicability to various industries such as finance, 
manufacturing, healthcare, and public sectors, as well as to non -routine document processing and exception -
prone tasks such as contract management, customer service, and legal review. Therefore, there is a need for 
case studies and effectiveness analysis reflecting the characteristics of each field.   
 Second, advanced research is required to enhance the domain -specific learning and precision of 
generative AI models. Additionally, integrating XAI (Explainable AI) techn ology to explain AI decision -
making can improve system transparency and user acceptance.   
 Third, research on an integrated approach is needed to discover automation target processes based on 
actual work log data through process mining technology and to q uantitatively analyze and optimize the 
operational effectiveness of automation systems.   
 Fourth, as intelligent automation spreads, it is necessary to analyze ethical and social impacts such as 
job restructuring, data privacy, and algorithmic bias, and t o conduct research on policy and institutional 
measu res to mitigate these issues.   
 Lastly, research is needed to explore the potential of multimodal AI -based automation technologies that 
can simultaneously understand and process various types of data bey ond text and ima ges, such as voice and 
video.   
Such follow -up studies are expected to enhance the practicality of intelligent automation technologies 
while making significant contributions to corporate digital transformation and sustainable work innovatio n.
