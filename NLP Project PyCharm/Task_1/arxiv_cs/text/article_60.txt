Abstract. AIXI is a widely studied model of artificial general intelligence (AGI) based upon
principles of induction and reinforcement learning. However, AIXI is fundamentally classical
in nature - as are the environments in which it is modelled. Given the universe is quantum
mechanical in nature and the exponential overhead required to simulate quantum mechanical
systems classically, the question arises as to whether there are quantum mechanical analogues
of AIXI which are theoretically consistent or practically feasible as models of universal in-
telligence. To address this question, we extend the framework to quantum information and
present Quantum AIXI (QAIXI). We introduce a model of quantum agent/environment in-
teraction based upon quantum and classical registers and channels, showing how quantum
AIXI agents may take both classical and quantum actions. We formulate the key components
of AIXI in quantum information terms, extending previous research on quantum Kolmogorov
complexity and a QAIXI value function. We discuss conditions and limitations upon quantum
Solomonoff induction and show how contextuality fundamentally affects QAIXI models.

1 Introduction
A cornerstone in the theoretical landscape of AGI is the AIXI model [33,34], which provides a
mathematically rigorous and complete framework for an optimal Bayesian reinforcement learning
agent. AIXI’s optimality is rooted in Solomonoff’s theory of universal induction [50] and classical
computability theory. However, AIXI and its underlying assumptions are fundamentally classical.
Given that our universe is governed by quantum mechanics, a fundamental question arises: what
constitutesuniversalintelligenceinaquantummechanicalworld?Thispaperaddressesthisquestion
by developing the mathematical foundations for Quantum AIXI (QAIXI), an AGI model operat-
ing within the principles of quantum mechanics. Using the formal theory of quantum information
processing, we extend prior work on quantum intelligence [15,44] and situate QAIXI as an agent
anchored in both quantum and classical registers interacting with the environment via quantum
and classical channels. Using this formulation, we contribute the following:
(a) Describing the QAIXI agent’s interaction loop using density operators and quantum measure-
ment theory along with specifying quantum Kolmogorov complexity ( KQ) [10,53] in terms of
quantum information channels and its role in a universal quantum prior.
(b) Utilising the theory of quantum-to-quantum (QTQ) and quantum-to-classical channels [56] to
describe the space of possible quantum environments.
(c) Formulating a quantum equivalent of the universal Bayesian mixture over quantum environ-
ments while adapting a quantum Bellman equation and the QAIXI policy based on quantum
formalism.2 E. Perrier
(d) Describing circumstances in which the Kochen-Specker theorem [38] renders any QAIXI history
fundamentally contextual.
As we discuss below, QAIXI is impractical to implement. Our contribution therefore aims to con-
tribute to debate over the theoretical models of optimal intelligence that account for the fundamen-
tallyquantumnatureoftheuniverse,particularlylimitationsstemmingfromtheinherentproperties
of quantum state spaces, quantum computation, and quantum measurement.
1.1 Related Work
AIXI [33–35] is among the leading AGI proposals at the centre of debates over AGI, as both a
model of universal intelligence and a proposal against which other proposals are assessed. It takes
Solomonoff’s universal induction, folds it into sequential decision theory, and produces what is ar-
guably the cleanest statement of an unbounded optimal agent. Subsequent symbolic, connectionist,
and hybrid AGI proposals typically position themselves by (i) trying to approximate AIXI in prac-
tice (e.g. AIXItl, MC-AIXI, information-geometric variants) or (ii) critiquing AIXI’s reliance on
classical assumptions and incomputable quantities. Logicist programmes [9], emergentist lines [51],
distributed cognitive architectures [26,27], and self-organising approaches [41] all share AIXI’s basic
agent–environment model, albeit while extending, varying or removing its component Bayesian ma-
chinery. AIXI has been subject to critical review over the last two decades on a number of grounds:
(1) physical unrealisability or super-Turing requirements [39,55]; (2) the Cartesian boundary be-
tween software and hardware [7,8]; (3) inadequate treatment of resource constraints, counterfactual
reasoning or multi-agent reflection [23,49]; and (4) challenges to the Kolmogorov-based prior it-
self [52]. Even so, AIXI remains a cornerstone of classical AGI (CAGI) theories. The advent of
quantum information technologies (QIT) [2,43] and interest in their computational capabilities and
quantum forms of AGI (QAGI) poses a natural question for AIXI models: if AIXI purports to be
a universal agent in a classical world, what replaces it in a quantum universe? Most quantum-AI
research to date is narrowly cast, focusing on specific technical features such as quantum decision
theory, quantum machine learning [11,16,21,45,48], quantum reinforcement learning [20,36,42],
and hybrid variational schemes [46,47]. These propose access to quantum algorithms providing
prospective quantum advantage (e.g. amplitude-estimation–based policy evaluation [40]), albeit
with ongoing debate about their practical reach [3].
Attempts to synthesise AIXI with quantum mechanics (and quantum information processing)
have been relatively limited. Work on Solomonoff induction [50] and quantum computation (e.g.
Deutsch’squantumTuringmachines[18])haveconsideredcomponentfeaturesoftheAIXIprogram,
including substituting out specific classical components for quantum analogues (e.g. replacing clas-
sical with quantum Grover search [15]). Yet quantum mechanics operationally - and ontologically -
carries profound differences from classical ontology (and computation). Quantum systems may sub-
sist in superposition states, be entangled and lack definitive identity until measurement interaction.
Moreover, any integration of quantum mechanics and AIXI must also reckon with seminal results
in quantum foundations: contextuality, non-locality, and quantum measurement — all absent from
classical AIXI. Work on quantum causality [14,57], algorithmic thermodynamics [22], and many-
worlds decision theory [54] offer contributions on foundational quantum mechanical issues facing
quantum AIXI-style agents whose quantum operations disturb the very environment they probe.
At present, however, there is neither a consensus quantum prior (the role played by 2−K(ν)in AIXI)
nor a tractable complexity class in which QAIXI could be approximated.2. CLASSICAL AIXI 3
2 Classical AIXI
The AIXI agent [33] is a theoretical model for a universally optimal reinforcement learning agent.
It interacts with an unknown environment µin cycles. In each cycle t, the agent chooses an action
at∈ Aand receives a percept et= (ot, rt)∈ O × [0,1], consisting of an observation otand a reward
rt. The history is h<t=a1e1. . . a t−1et−1. AIXI’s policy πAIXIaims to maximise future expected
rewards:

where mis the lifetime of the agent, γ∈[0,1)is a discount factor, and the inner sum is over

prior ξU:
ξU(e1:m||a1:m) :=X
ν∈Msol2−K(ν)ν(e1:m||a1:m). (2)
AIXI is Pareto-optimal and self-optimising in the sense of [33]. However, it is incomputable due to
the use of K(·)and the sum over all CTMs. Its ontological assumptions are classical: deterministic
or classically stochastic environments, objective histories, and classical information theory.
3 Quantum Computational Foundations
3.1 Quantum information
To construct QAIXI, we must replace classical computational notions with their quantum counter-
parts.However,thisisnotastraightforwardisomorphicmapping.Theuniquepropertiesofquantum
mechanics problematise conventional assumptions underlying classical AIXI, such as agent identity,
definitiveness of state and the separability and distinguishability of an agent from its environment.
To formulate QAIXI in a way that accommodates and caters for these ontological differences, we
turn to the language and formalism of quantum information theory [56]. In QIP, systems(agents)
andenvironments are described in terms of registers X(e.g. bits) comprising information drawn
from a classical alphabet Σ. Registers may be in either classical or quantum states. We define
a Hilbert space X=C|Σ|with computational basis {|s⟩}s∈Σ. Aquantum state of a register X
(associated with space X) is a density operator ρ∈ D(X), i.e., a positive semi-definite operator
with Tr (ρ) = 1. Classical states are then ρwhich are diagonal in the basis of X. Interactions with
(and changes to) states occur via channels which are superoperators. They define how quantum
and classical states interact. Classical-to-classical registers (CTC) preserve classical states, classical-
to-quantum (CTQ) channels encode classical information in quantum states, quantum-to-classical
(QTC) channels extract classical information from quantum states, decohering them in the pro-
cess; quantum-to-quantum (QTQ) channels form coherent (e.g. unitary) transformations between
quantum registers. In this framing, both agents and environments are registers which may be CAGI
(classical state sets) or QAGI (quantum state sets). They may interact in ways that are coherent
(quantum-preserving) or classical (via CTC or QTC maps).4 E. Perrier
3.2 Quantum AIXI
The components of QAIXI can then be understood as follows. Let the QAIXI agent be associ-
ated with a quantum register Arepresenting the internal degrees of freedom, while its environment
is represented by a quantum register E. Their corresponding (finite–dimensional) complex Hilbert
spaces are denoted by HAandHE. At interaction step tthe agent’s private state is a density
operator ρ(t)
A∈ D(HA)that may encode its complete history, its current belief state, or—in the
ideal case—an explicit representation of the universal quantum mixture ΞQ. The environment is
simultaneously described by ρ(t)
E∈ D(HE). Taken together the composite system occupies the joint
state ρ(t)
AE∈ D(HA⊗ H E). Note that ρ(t)
AEcan be entangled, so that ρ(t)
AE̸=ρ(t)
A⊗ρ(t)
E. A history is
therefore an operator-valued stochastic process rather than a sequence of point events.
Actions .Ateachcycletheagentchoosesan action at,formallyacompletely–positive,trace–preserving
(CPTP)mapacting ontheenvironmentregister(orona designatedsubsystemofthe jointregister).
The two canonical cases are as follows.
1. First, when the agent performs a coherent control operation, atis realised by a unitary channel
ΦUat:X7→UatX U†
at, applied either on HEalone or on HA⊗ H E. Such a map preserves
superposition and entanglement and therefore belongs to the quantum-to-quantum (QTQ) class
of channels.
2. Second, the agent may decide to interrogate the environment by means of a quantum in-
strument Iat={Eat
k}k∈Γobs, where the outcome alphabet Γobsis classical. Each branch map
Eat
k:L(HE′)→ L(HE′)is completely positive and trace non–increasing, satisfiesP

k=Eat
(their sum is a CPTP map) and Eat†
k(I) =I, and typically takes the form Eat
k(X) =Mat
kX Mat
k†
for a POVM {Mat
k}. Because every branch deposits a classical record kwhile decohering the
measured subsystem, Iatis a paradigmatic quantum-to-classical (QTC) channel.
Formally the action atcan be represented via Φat:L(HAE)−→ L (HAE)which may be indexed
by the form of L.
Percepts and rewards . What the QAIXI agent perceives is determined entirely by the instrument
it applies. A measurement outcome k∈Γobsbecomes the observation component otof the percept
et= (ot, rt). The outcome is drawn with probability

.
The reward rt∈Γrew(with Γrew⊆Rin the standard reinforcement-learning setting) is computed
by a classical post-processing function that may depend on both otand the agent’s prior internal
state ρ(t−1)
A. The resulting data otandrtare stored in designated registers - but it is at this stage
classical data. So it can be stored in a classical register via a CTC map, or encoded in a quantum
register via a CTQ map.
Interaction loop . The QAIXI cycle of interaction with the environment is as follows. Given the
pre-interaction state ρ(t−1)
AE, the agent selects at. Ifatis a unitary, the composite state updates

3.3 Quantum Kolmogorov complexity
QAIXI relies upon quantum (rather than classical) Kolmogorov complexity. Let Qsolbe the set of
all chronological, semi–computable quantum environments, each such environment Q∈ Qsolbeing
representedbyaQuantumTuringMachinethatoutputsaninstrumentsequence.An environment Q

for a universal QTM Uunivand fixed ε <1with Hilbert-Schmidt norm ||·||. Equation (4) therefore
measures program length needed to approximate the channel Q. The|aux⟩term is an ancilla whose
dimension is at most polynomial in |p|. Here we have assumed that for any two universal QTMs
U1, U2there exists a constant cU1,U2such that for every environment Q:

The quantum Solomonoff mixture is the semi–density operator:

where ρQ
E(a1:m)is the environment state generated by Qunder the action sequence a1:m. Projecting
ΞQonto any classical POVM recovers the probability mixture ξQ(e1:m∥a1:m)that generalises (2).
Whenever every admissible environment Qoutputs commuting observables and the QAIXI agent
restricts itself to instruments diagonal in that basis, each ρQ
E(a1:m)becomes a diagonal density
operatorencodinganordinaryprobabilitymeasure.Inthatlimit KQ(Q)coincides(uptoanadditive
constant) with the classical Kolmogorov complexity K(ν)of the induced CTM ν, and equations (6)–
(9) reduce exactly to the classical Solomonoff prior ξUand the AIXI policy (1). Hence the quantum
formulation strictly generalises the classical one.6 E. Perrier

. Here ρ(t)
AE(k)is the post-measurement state with prob-
abilities as pt(k|at). The fix-point equation implicit in ((8)–9) is the quantum Bellman equation .
The act of observation fundamentally alters ρEdue to quantum back-action. Note that as we are
dealing with quantum trajectories, the classical notion of histories h<tmust now account for the
sequence of quantum operations and classical outcomes. Moreover, because a universal QTM may
not halt on superposed inputs and is itself not computable. The substitution K⇝KQleaves the
mixture (6) just as incomputable as its classical counterpart and introduces an additional obstacle:
evaluating ρQ
E(a1:m)is in general computationally hard even for m= 1. However, preparing an
arbitrary n-qubit quantum state |ψ⟩can require a quantum circuit of size exponential in n[37].
This implies that KQ(|ψ⟩)can be exponentially larger (in qubit count) than nfor complex states,
unlike classical K(x)which is at most ℓ(x) +c(only if xis the program itself, not an arbitrary
binary string). The upper bound is still O(2n)bits. Practical approximations therefore hinge on
identifying structured subclasses of Qsol(e.g. stabiliser processes or tensor-network environments)
for which both KQand the Born probabilities are efficiently approximable.
4 Quantum Solomonoff Induction (QSI)
Classical Solomonoff induction assigns to every finite data string a universal a-priori probability ob-
tained by summing, with complexity–based weights, over all computable environments that could
have produced that string. In the quantum setting the data arriving at an agent are the classical
outcomes of instrument branches executed on a quantum environment. The Quantum Solomonoff
Induction formalism therefore replaces probability measures by semi-density operators and Kol-
mogorov codes by quantum program states .
Environment class and universal mixture . LetQsoldenote the set of all chronological, semi-
computable quantum environments. Each Q∈ Q solis specified by a program p(Q)∈ {0,1}∗
for a fixed universal QTM Uuniv. Running p(Q)produces, step by step, a sequence of CPTP
maps that act on the environment register and a measurement specification for the classical tran-
script. Here Qplays the role of νin the classical case. Its quantum Kolmogorov complexity is4. QUANTUM SOLOMONOFF INDUCTION (QSI) 7
KQ(Q) := min {|p(Q)|:Uuniv(p(Q))≃Q}.For an action sequence a1:mwe write ρQ
E(a1:m)∈ D(HE)
for the (generally mixed) state that Qprepares on the environment register immediately before the
observation at cycle m. Theuniversal semi-density operator conditional on the agent’s actions is
then:

Bayesian updates . Given a history h<t= (a1:t−1, e1:t−1), the posterior semi-density operator
is obtained by the update followed by a renormalisation:

4.1 Convergence theorem
Analogous to classical Solomonoff induction, under certain conditions we might expect QSI to
exhibit convergence properties. The convergence properties of QSI are complex and remain an open
question. To sketch out the issues, we consider the following model (see Appendix D for more
detail). Write D(ρ∥σ) =Tr[ρ(lnρ−lnσ)]for theUmegaki relative entropy . Fix a true quantum
environment Q⋆∈ Qsoland let ρ⋆
E(a1:m)be its state sequence. We assume:
(C1) Ergodicity. There is a δ >0such that for every admissible action policy the time-averaged
state satisfies: lim inf m→∞1

Finally, the quantum Pinsker inequality [17] turns this 1/tbound on relative entropy into an
O(t−1/2)bound on trace distance, completing the convergence claim. The replacement of full in-
formational completeness by ϵ-completeness introduces an extra O(ϵ)term in the Pinsker bound,
which vanishes as ϵ→0. Equation (11) is executed by the internal belief-revision QTQ channel Uint.
The posterior Ξ(t)
Qsupplies the conditional expectation required for the quantum Bellman equa-
tion (9). QSI is the inductive basis of QAIXI concentrating weight on environments that remain
compatiblewithclassicalmeasurements.Inthecommutinglimitthetheoremreducestotheclassical
Solomonoff convergence bound [33]. A formal proof would need to justify martingale convergence
for operator-valued universal mixtures under quantum measurement dynamics (App. D).
4.2 QSI Limitations
Aside from the computational complexity considerations of QSI (which we postpone for future
work), several other significant challenges arise with QSI:
1.Specifying QsolandKQ(·). A universal class of computable quantum environments must be fixed,
e.g. the set of all chronological, semi–computable QTMs that output instrument sequences. The
quantum description-length KQ(Q)is then the length of the shortest qubit-string that drives
a fixed universal QTM to approximate the environment Qwithin trace-distance ε. Proving
universality and invariance up to an additive constant—standard for classical Kolmogorov com-
plexity—is technically subtler in the quantum setting because programs may themselves be in
superposition. Moreover, if an environment is weakly entangled, this may ultimately mean a
classical AIXI can effectively approximate QAIXI’s value function.
2.Measurement back-action . Born probabilities PrQ(e1:m∥a1:m)are computed from the iterated
CPTP maps that model the interaction loop (Sec. 3.2). Each measurement branch both yields
the classical outcome otandupdatesthe post-measurement state ρ(t)
E7→ρ(t+1)
E(ot). Because
measurementalters ρE,thequantumback-actionmakestheexpectationintheBellmanequation
dependent on the sequence of quantum operations and classical outcomes in a complex, non-
Markovian way, so the likelihood of future data depends on the entire history h<tat.
3.Non-localityand contextuality .When Qpreparesentangledstates,thejointdistribution PrQ(e1:m∥a1:m)
can violate Bell inequalities [6] and exhibit contextual dependence on the full instrument se-
quence. QSI must therefore aggregate over models that are notrepresentable by any classical
hidden-variable process, which complicates identifiability and convergence analyses.
4.Incomputability and resource sensitivity of the prior .Likeitsclassicalcounterpart, KQisuncom-
putable. Moreover, the weight 2−KQ(Q)does not penalise the physical resources needed either to
prepare the initial state of Qor to simulate its dynamics—tasks that can be exponential-time or
generally infeasible. For physically realistic prediction one may replace KQby a resource-aware
complexity measure that incorporates, for example, circuit depth or Trotter step count.4. QUANTUM SOLOMONOFF INDUCTION (QSI) 9
5.Quantum error correction (QEC) . Implementing QAIXI on real, noisy hardware requires quan-
tum error correction. Encoding each logical qubit in hundreds-to-thousands of physical qubits
both (i) inflates the effective description-length, shifting the universal prior toward far simpler
environments, and (ii) introduces continual syndrome-measurement back-action whose residual
logical noise is only bounded below a code-specific threshold—together, these effects raise the
resource bar and weaken the assumptions (ergodicity and informational completeness) behind
potential convergence guarantees.
Moreover, there are specific challenges to QAIXI and QSI raised by quantum foundational issues.
Bell non-locality . In any QAIXI environment that distributes entangled subsystems to space-
like separated agent components the joint percept distribution can violate the CHSH inequality.
No classical hidden-variable environment νcan reproduce those statistics. A classical ξUassigns
zero mass to each Bell-violating local hypothesis, so only the quantum mixture ξQhas non-trivial
mass to contribute. When the agent exploits Bell-type correlations for decision-making, its percepts
are no longer conditionally-independent given the entire history, breaking the martingale structure
assumed in Theorem 1. See Appendix F.
Kochen–Specker contextuality . If the true environment prepares a KS set of projectors, then
there exists nohistory-independent map v:P(HE)→{0,1}assigning pre-existing outcomes to ev-
ery measurement the agent may perform. QSI must therefore sum over hypotheses whose outcome
statistics depend on the entire future instrument sequence up to horizon m. Bayesian updates must
track non-commuting observables (see Appendix E.1)..
Theorem 2. Let{P1, . . . , P n} ⊂ P (H)be a Kochen–Specker uncolourable set whose projectors sum
to the identity operator on H, i.e. there exists nomapv:P(H)→{0,1}satisfyingPk
i=1v(Πi) = 1
for every projector decompositionPk
i=1Πi=⊮that contains only elements of the set. Let Ibe
any instrument whose Kraus operators are polynomials in the Pjand whose action is confined to
the support H. Thennoquantum Turing machine Qcan output, for every action sequence a1:man
agent might perform, a commuting family of projectors {Qa1:m(e1:m)}such that

uncolourability. Therefore a perfect, non-disturbing predictor Qcannot exist.
Contextuality problematises the straightforward analogy with classical history in AIXI albeit sub-
ject to the extent to which environments actually do manifest uncolourable equivalents. Because10 E. Perrier
a universal classical history h<tcannot determine simultaneously the outcomes of all future in-
struments, any Bayesian update rule that conditions the QSI posterior on h<taloneis necessarily

No-cloning. Evaluating the quantum likelihood PrQ(e1:m∥a1:m)requiresfreshcopies of the pre-
measurement state ρQ
E(a1:m), but the no-cloning theorem forbids their duplication from a single
run. Hence each Bayesian update consumes the very evidence it needs for validation; the sample
complexity of learning scales with the number of distinct instruments explored, whereas in the
classical case the same trajectory can be replayed arbitrarily often. Two consequences of the above
are that: (a) convergence proofs must be context-sensitive ; a single universal mixture cannot assign
fixed probabilities to all quantum experiments simultaneously; and (b) even under ideal identifia-
bility the learning rate is limited by state-preparation resources giving rise to sample complexity
consequences for any QAIXI agent. See Appendix F.2.
5 Conclusion and Open Questions
Wehavelaidoutananalysisofandquantuminformationprocessing-basedmathematicalframework
for Quantum AIXI, a universal intelligent agent designed to operate within a quantum mechanical
universe. We have shown, using our channel and register-based model of agent/environment inter-
action in the quantum setting, how quantum analogues of universal intelligence components can be
constructed. However there are significant limitations to QAIXI. Firstly, it is nowhere near being a
practical proposal: QEC requires millions of physical qubits for even modest logical qubit counts;
maintaining extended coherence for QAIXI decision cycles remains far beyond existing technology.
Theoretically, QAIXI relies on quantum Kolmogorov complexity for its universal prior and quantum
Turing machines to model environments. Key challenges include the incomputability of quantum
Kolmogorov complexity, the exponential resources often required for quantum state preparation
and simulation of quantum dynamics (when performed classically), complexity of calculating prob-
abilities. The quantum Bellman equation involves expectations over quantum measurements and
evolutions that are contextual. Moreover, exactly when QAIXI would provide a quantum advantage
is an open question (see App. B). As interest in both computational agency and quantum infor-
mation processing grows, understanding the capabilities and constraints of integrating quantum
technologies into AGI systems will become of increasing focus. Further research directions include:
1.Computable Approximations : Can meaningful, computable (or efficiently quantum-computable)
approximations to QAIXI be developed? What restrictions on the class of quantum environ-
ments MQ,solor the definition of KQwould make this possible?
2.Convergence Rates and Bounds : Rigorously establishing convergence theorems for QSI and
deriving tight bounds on convergence rates, taking into account quantum information-theoretic
limits (e.g., Holevo information, quantum data processing inequalities), in light of learnability
and tomography [1] e.g. How does quantum measurement back-action affect learning speed?
3.Quantum Resources : How do quantum resources like entanglement, if available to the agent
for its internal processing or for interacting with the environment, affect the performance or
complexity of QAIXI?
4.Impact of Quantum Interpretations : While this paper focused on the standard (Copenhagen-
like) measurement formalism, how would adopting alternative interpretations (e.g., Everettian
Many-Worlds, Bohmian Mechanics [12], QBism [25]) alter the definition of QAIXI’s optimality,
its policy, or its perceived complexity? For example, in an Everettian setting, does QAIXI
optimise expected reward across trajectories or branches [19,54]?5. CONCLUSION AND OPEN QUESTIONS 11

the fully quantum regime.
B Quantum Advantage for QAIXI
A fundamental question for any quantum extension of classical AIXI is: under what circumstances
does quantum processing provide genuine computational advantages? We examine this question
below in the case of specific environment classes where classical simulation becomes intractable.
B.1 Boson Sampling Environments
An common reference for assessments of quantum computational advantage over classical proto-
cols is that of boson sampling [5], a non-universal photonic quantum protocol that injects indis-
tinguishable single photons into a fixed linear interferometer and samples output patterns whose
probabilities are governed by matrix permanents which is considered exponentially hard for classical
computers. Let Bndenote the class of quantum environments that embed boson sampling processes
as follows. Each environment Q∈ Bnmaintains an n-mode optical interferometer described by a
random unitary matrix U∈U(n)drawn from the Haar measure. On each cycle, Qaccepts a clas-
sical action atspecifying input photon configuration. It then evolves the state via U, and outputs
measurement outcomes from a fixed detection scheme. Suppose there exists a family {Qn} ⊂ B n
such that (a) generating one percept from Qnrequires poly( n)quantum operations; and (b) com-
puting the output distribution to total variation distance <2−nis#P-hard. In such a case, any
classical AIXI with total running time fails to approximate the optimal value unless the polynomial
hierarchy collapses.C. INFORMATION-THEORETIC LIMITS ON QAIXI 15
ThiscanbeunderstoodbyconsideringhowAIXI’svaluefunctionrequiresaccurateestimationofen-
vironment transition probabilities. For Qn∈ Bn, this reduces to sampling from the boson sampling
distribution.Theoriginalbosonsamplingconjectureinvolvesclassicalsimulationwhich,tobewithin
the required accuracy, would yield an algorithm for computing permanents of Gaussian random ma-
trices—a problem conjectured to be #P-complete which would collapse the hierarchy, contradicting
standard complexity-theoretic assumptions. In terms of value functions, let ˆVclassicaldenote the
value function computed by any polynomial-time classical agent. If |ˆVclassical−V∗
Qn|<1/poly( n),
then the agent must distinguish between boson sampling distributions and uniform distributions
over the same support—a task equivalent to permanent estimation within exponential precision. In
this way, boson sampling provides an in principle litmus test for quantum advantage, albeit with
limited applicability to specific tasks AIXI or QAIXI would undertake. The boson sampling example
illustrates how QAIXI’s computational advantage over classical AIXI is contingent on environments
involving problems which are classically hard.
B.2 Structured Environment Classes
The example above raises the obvious question of when do quantum environments admit efficient
classical approximation? We draw upon results in quantum information to illustrate when this
may be true in the case of weakly entangled systems. In quantum formalism, an environment Qis
called aMatrix Product Environment (MPE) with bond dimension χif its state evolution can be
represented as:
ρ(t)
E= Tr aux"nO
i=1A[t]
i(χ)#
(17)
where each A[t]
i(χ)is aχ×χmatrix depending on the history up to time t. The question then
becomes how classically learnable is an MPE? Let Eχdenote the class of all MPEs with bond
dimension χ=O(1). Then there exists a classical polynomial-time agent that ε-approximates
QAIXI’svaluefunctiononany Q∈ Eχwithsamplecomplexity O(poly( n, ε−1)).Thebonddimension
of an MPE is the size of tensors used to represent the MPE and is a figure that relates to the
complexity of the representation and the extent of its entanglement. The key observation is that
MPEswithconstant bond dimension admitefficient tomographyusing classicalshadowtomography
[4] which can, in certain cases, reduce the observables required to calculate the expectation values
of exponentially many observables of an unknown quantum state to only logarithmic number of
randomised measurements of that state.
C Information-Theoretic Limits on QAIXI
Information-theoretic limits upon quantum information processing and measurement [56] that are
well-studied in QIP also have consequences for any QAIXI proposal. For example, the no-cloning
theorem discussed above imposes fundamental limits on QAIXI’s learning efficiency that have no
classical analog. Since QAIXI observes each environment state only once per trajectory, convergence
rates for learning the current environment state precisely are limited. For quantum environments
with parameter vector θ∈Θ⊂Rd, the quantum Fisher information matrix provides fundamental16 E. Perrier
bounds on parameter estimation. For example, for a parametric quantum state ρ(θ), the quantum
Fisher information matrix has elements:
[IQ(θ)]jk=1
2Tr [ρ(θ){∂jL(θ), ∂kL(θ)}] (18)
where L(θ)is the symmetric logarithmic derivative. Moreover, the quantum Cramér-Rao bound [56]
(a bound on optimal precision for estimating parameters from quantum measurements) means that
any QAIXI agent estimating environment parameters θfrom Tmeasurement outcomes satisfies:
E[(ˆθ−θ)(ˆθ−θ)T]≥1
TIQ(θ)−1(19)
This bound is generally tighter than the classical Fisher information bound, reflecting the additional
constraints imposed by quantum measurement. QAIXI’s potential advantage would likely emerge
in environments where this structure aligns with quantum computational advantages.
D QSI Detail and Limitations
Here we discuss conditions on QSI (Theorem 1) in particular some of the challenges facing proving
convergence.

To show this, recall that each density operator ρQ
Eis associated with a quantum state Qwhere Q∗
denotes the true environmental state. Ξ(t)
Qdescribes the agent’s best assessment as to the true state
of the environment ρ∗
Eat time t(we leave the time dependence of ρunderstood). The QAIXI belief
state is a weighting using such descriptions over each possible state density operator:
ΞQ=ωQ∗ρ∗

E.
TheωQterms reflect the descriptions of state Q. The shortest description of Qis given by KQ(Q)
where simpler descriptions get more weight via ωQ= 2−KQ(Q). In classical minimum description
length (MDL) formalism, the code length of a data sequence is a combination of the model com-
plexity (description length) and likelihood of data under the chosen model (a dilution term). The

where:
g=X

ΞQis not yet normalised and ρEremains a semi-density operator as Tr ρE≤1i.e. as with the
classical case Zis sub-normalised e.g. Z=P
QωQ≤1for prefix-free codes with binary word-
lengths (see [28]). To apply the martingale and chain-rule identities we require density (not semi-
density) operators. To do so, we note the correct model’s share of the total description mass (the
effective prior mass of the true environment inside the normalised mixture) is:
ωQ∗

Z=ωQ∗(1 +g)
The normalised prior at time t= 0is then given by:

assuming Tr (ρQ

of perfect information (so g= 0) it reduces to the complexity KQ(Q∗) ln 2. To assume the more
familiar MDL form (which includes both complexity and dilution terms) we can scale c(while
remaining within the bounds above) e.g. c=ω2

implies an O(t−1/2)convergence rate for the expected trace distance. Thus any measurement strat-
egy can separate the agent’s belief from the true state only with probability vanishing like t−1/2.D. QSI DETAIL AND LIMITATIONS 19
This means that as the agent accumulates more data (as tincreases), its belief state Ξ(t)
Q(a1:t)not
only becomes a better approximation of the true state ρ⋆
E(a1:t)in terms of information-theoretic
divergence, but also becomes increasingly indistinguishable from the true state via any physical
measurement. The maximum probability of successfully distinguishing the agent’s belief from the
true state diminishes as t−1/2. This transition from a 1/trate for a quadratic-like loss (relative
entropy can be seen as a generalised squared error in the space of probability distributions or den-
sity matrices) to a t−1/2rate for an L1-like distance (trace distance is the quantum analogue of
total variation distance) is a common theme in statistical inference. It mirrors, for instance, aspects
of the classical Bernstein–von Mises theorem where posterior distributions concentrate around the
true parameter value. Importantly, this O(t−1/2)rate for distinguishability is derived without need-
ing any assumptions beyond those already made for establishing the relative entropy bound (i.e.,
conditions (C1)–(C3) that underpin Theorem 1).
D.2 Conditions on QSI
Establishing the convergence of QSI is challenging because of the conditions that would need to
subsist:
1.(C1) Ergodicity: There is a δ >0such that for every admissible action policy the time-averaged
(with respect to each admissible instrument schedule) state of the true environment Q⋆satisfies
lim inf
m→∞1
mmX
k=1ρ⋆
E(a1:k)−ρ⋆
E(a1:k−1)
1≤δ.
This condition implies that the environment’s state does not change too erratically on average,
ensuring that past observations retain some relevance for predicting future states.
2.(C2) Informational Completeness: Each cycle’s instrument (measurement) has a POVM refine-
ment whose classical Fisher information matrix is full-rank up to error ϵ >0. This means the
agent’s measurements are sufficiently informative to distinguish different quantum states, which
is crucial for learning.
3.(C3) Complexity Gap: The true environment Q⋆has finite quantum Kolmogorov complexity,
KQ(Q⋆)<∞, and the sum of relative complexities of other environments:
g:=X
Q̸=Q⋆2− 
KQ(Q)−KQ(Q⋆)
is finite. This ensures Q⋆is not infinitely complex relative to the universal QTM and has a
non-vanishing initial weight in the QSI mixture, and that the collective weight of alternative
hypotheses is manageable.
D.3 Comparison with classical SI
In our sketch above, we have adapted the typical classical approach for convergence of classical SI.
1. Likelihood Operators and Initial Divergence Bound: The QSI mixture ΞQ(a1:m)(Eq. (10)) is
a semi-density operator representing the agent’s belief about the environment state before the m-
th observation, given actions a1:m. The posterior Ξ(t)
Qis obtained via updates based on observed20 E. Perrier
outcomes (Eq. (11)). A first step, analogous to classical Solomonoff induction, is to bound the ini-
tial information deficit of the QSI mixture with respect to the true environment Q⋆. This initial
divergence, D0=D(ρ⋆
E∥Ξ(0)
Q), where Ξ(0)
Qis the initial QSI prior, can be bounded by the quantum
Kolmogorov complexity of the true environment:
D0≤KQ(Q⋆) ln 2 + ln(1 + g). (33)
This bound reflects that the cost of encoding the true environment within the universal mixture
is related to its complexity KQ(Q⋆), and the term ln(1 + g)accounts for the mass of alternative
hypotheses. Establishing this bound rigorously for semi-density operators and Umegaki relative
entropy is central to a full proof.
2. Monotonicity of Quantum Relative Entropy and Martingale Argument: The core of the conver-
genceargumenthingesonthedata-processinginequalityforquantumrelativeentropy.Thisprinciple
states that for any quantum operation (a completely-positive trace-preserving map, CPTP map),
such as a measurement branch Mekoccurring in the Bayesian update, the relative entropy between
any two states cannot increase: D(M(ρ)∥M(σ))≤D(ρ∥σ). Recall the likelihood operators ΛQ
t:=
Met◦···◦M e1(ρQ
E(a1:t))where ρQ
E(a1:t)is interpreted as the initial state on which the sequence of
CPTP maps Me1, . . . ,Metact.) Eq. (15) states that D(ρ⋆
E∥ΞQ)−D(Λ⋆
k∥ΛΞ
k)isEQ⋆-martingale.
Specifically, if Dk=D(ρ⋆(k)
E∥Ξ(k)
Q)is the divergence between the true state and the posterior after
kobservation-update cycles, then EQ⋆[Dk|history h<k]≤Dk−1. The divergence, on average, tends
to decrease or stay the same. The decline in divergence at step k,∆k=Dk−1−Eek∼Q⋆[Dk|h<k],
is therefore non-negative. As a result, the assumption C2is needed to ensure that if the poste-
riorΞ(k−1)
Qis not perfectly aligned with the true state ρ⋆(k−1)
E. Measurement provides additional
information that leads to a decrease in uncertainty (and greater weighting of the QAIXI belief Ξ
towards the true state ( gdeclines while ωQ∗increases).
3. Average Divergence: By summing these non-negative expected drops over tinteraction cycles,
we get:
tX
k=1EQ⋆,hist[∆k] =EQ⋆,hist[D0−Dt]≤D0,
where D0is the initial divergence bounded as in Eq. (33), and Dt=D(ρ⋆
E(a1:t)∥Ξ(t)
Q(a1:t))is the
divergence at step t. This implies that the sum of positive one-step learning gains (in terms of
divergence reduction) is bounded by the initial total ignorance D0. The result that:
EQ⋆[Dt]≤D0
t=KQ(Q⋆) ln 2 + ln(1 + g)
t.
shows that the expected divergence at time titself must decrease on average This establishes that
the expected relative entropy between the true environment state and the QSI posterior converges
to zero at a rate of 1/t.
4. Quantum Pinsker Inequality for Trace Distance Convergence: Finally, the quantum Pinsker in-
equality provides a link between the trace distance ∥ρ−σ∥1(a measure of distinguishability) and
the relative entropy D(ρ∥σ):
1
2∥ρ−σ∥2
1≤D(ρ∥σ).D. QSI DETAIL AND LIMITATIONS 21

would typically introduce an additional error term in the bounds, which vanishes as ϵ→0.
D.4 Limitations
The proof sketch above, while following a known pattern, relies on several steps that require careful
and rigorous justification in the quantum setting:
1.Martingale Theory for Quantum Processes . Classical martingale convergence theorems are well-
established for sequences of real-valued random variables with respect to a filtration. Extending
these to sequences of quantum states (density operators or, as here, semi-density operators like
ΞQ) that evolve via quantum operations (measurements and unitary evolutions) is a significant
technical hurdle. The notion of a filtration Ftmust properly capture the information gained
from sequences of quantum measurements, which is complicated by measurement back-action,
the non-commutative nature of observables, and potential contextuality.
2.Relative Entropy with Semi-Density Operators . The Umegaki relative entropy D(ρ∥σ)is typi-
cally defined for density operators ρandσ(where Tr ρ=Trσ= 1). We have set out how this
would be adjusted (normalised) in order to render it a full density operator. An alternative
approach given the QSI mixture ΞQis a semi-density operator (Tr ΞQ≤1) is for the derivation
- and properties (like monotonicity under CPTP maps), and the Pinsker inequality - to be
established or appropriately adapted for semi-density operators.
3.Measurement Back-Action . Each measurement Mekprovides a classical outcome ekand trans-
forms the quantum state. The sequences of true states ρ⋆
E(a1:k)and posterior beliefs Ξ(k)
Q(a1:k)
are conditioned on the full history of actions a1:kand prior outcomes e1:k−1. The calculation of
the expected drop in divergence requires careful averaging over outcomes ekgenerated by the
true environment Q⋆acting on its state ρ⋆
E(a1:k−1). The ergodicity condition (C1) is important
in ensuring that the learning process is meaningful over time and does not get stuck due to
highly non-stationary state sequences.
4.Contextuality and Non-locality . As we discuss, if the true environment Q⋆exhibits Kochen-
Specker contextuality or Bell non-locality, the classical intuition that a history uniquely deter-
mines future outcome probabilities (independent of measurement choices for other compatible
observables) breaks down. The requirement for an adapted, context-aware filtration complicates
the structure of the conditional expectations inherent in any martingale argument e.g. standard
assumptions of conditional independence of percepts, often used in classical proofs, are violated.
However, the practical implications of these foundational issues may be more or less significant
depending on context (see the Appendix section below for an extended discussion).22 E. Perrier
5.Informational Completeness .Condition(C2)assertsthatmeasurementsaresufficientlyinforma-
tive (Fisher information matrix is full-rank up to ϵ), the precise manner in which this guarantees
a sufficient trend towards convergence at each step needs would require further analysis. For
example, how (and whether) the error ϵpropagates into the final convergence bounds and rates
is would be open question.
6.No-Cloning and Sample Complexity . The no cloning theorem fundamentally limits the agent’s
ability to learn. A QAIXI agent cannot make multiple measurements on identical copies of a
past unperturbed quantum state to refine its likelihood estimates for different actions from
that state as measurement consumes the state. This underscores the online and single-shot
nature of quantum learning from a trajectory. It also has consequences for the effective sample
complexity of learning undertaken by any QAIXI and is a significant difference from classical
scenarios where data can often be re-analysed. Note that if i.i.d. copies at negligible cost, the
no-cloning impact may be minimal.
While the QSI convergence theorem sketch outlines a potentially plausible route to proving that a
QAIXI-like agent can learn its quantum environment, a full proof faces unresolved theoretical and
technical challenges. These primarily arise from the foundational differences between classical and
quantum information processing, particularly concerning measurement, state representation, and
contextuality. Addressing these issues remains a significant open research area in the theoretical
foundations of quantum artificial general intelligence.E. FOUNDATIONAL IMPLICATIONS FOR QAIXI 23
E Foundational Implications for QAIXI
The Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem [38] is a cornerstone of quantum foundations, reflecting central
differences between quantum and classical descriptions of reality. It states that for quantum systems
of dimension three or higher, it is impossible to assign definite, pre-existing values to all possible
measurements (observables) in a way that is independent of the context of measurement (i.e., the
orderofmeasurementoperationsandwhichothercompatibleobservablesaremeasuredalongsideit).
Here we elaborate in more detail on the implications of KS contextuality for the QAIXI framework,
particularly concerning Theorem 2.
E.1 Contextuality and QAIXI’s Universal Mixture
Classical AIXI operates under the assumption that an environment νhas definite properties that
can be observed. The history h<tis a sequence of such definite observations. However, if the true
quantum environment Q⋆leads to states whose measurements exhibit contextuality, then QAIXI’s
understanding of Q∗will differ from the classical case. Recall Theorem 2 provides that no quantum
Turing machine Q(representing a predictive model for the environment) can output a commuting
family of projectors {Qa1:m(e1:m)}that perfectly predicts outcomes for a KS-uncolourable set of
measurements (Eq. (16)). The consequence for QAIXI’s belief state, ΞQ(a1:m)(defined in Eq. (10)),
issignificant.QAIXI’sbeliefisamixturethatsumsoverallsemi-computablequantumenvironments
Q∈ Qsol. IfQ⋆is KS-contextual, then any individual Qwithin the sum that attempts to model Q⋆
using classical, non-contextual hidden variables (or by outputting commuting projectors that aim
to assign definite values independent of measurement choices) will fail to accurately reproduce the
statistics of Q⋆. Thus, for ΞQto converge to a description of Q⋆, it must implicitly give dominant
weight to models Qthat are themselves contextual or whose predictive mechanisms do not rely on
non-contextual value assignments.
E.2 Contextuality Consequences for Learning
In classical AIXI, the history h<tis a sequence of action-percept pairs, where percepts are assumed
to be objective records of definite environmental properties via measurement. For QAIXI situated
within a contextual quantum environment, the situation is more nuanced. The outcome otof a
measurement action atmay not be interpretable as revealing a pre-existing property Pjof the
system. Instead, otis realised only upon measurement. Intuitively, its probability (and even its
meaning) can depend on the complete set of compatible observables measured in action at. To see
this, let Q⋆be an environment that prepares a qutrit ( d= 3) system. Suppose QAIXI can choose
actions atthat correspond to measuring sets of compatible projectors from a KS set (e.g., a set of
projectors for a qutrit as in the Peres-Mermin square, or simpler KS sets). Let P1, P2, . . . , P nbe
such a KS set.
–If QAIXI performs action a1measuring the context C1={Pi, Pj, Pk}(where Pi+Pj+Pk=I),
it obtains outcomes (oi, oj, ok).
–Ifitlater(orinacounterfactualscenario)performsaction a2measuringcontext C2={Pi, Pl, Pm}
(where Pi+Pl+Pm=I), it obtains outcomes (o′
i, o′
l, o′
m).
The KS theorem implies that QAIXI cannot learn a universal value assignment v(Px)∈ {0,1}such
thatoi=v(Pi)ando′
i=v(Pi)consistently across all contexts for all projectors in the KS set, while24 E. Perrier

Px∈Cv(Px) = 1for all contexts C. This means that the Bayesian update rule for

..., must process the information et−1(which
includes ot−1) in a way that acknowledges its contextual nature. The meaning of ot−1for updating
beliefsabout Q⋆istiedtothefullinstrument Met−1andpotentiallythesetofallmeasurementsthat
constituted action at−1. This is why the posterior must be refined by the entire future instrument
schedule (or at least the current one) if one aims for precise predictions in contextual scenarios. A
simple classical history string h<tis insufficient.
E.3 Convergence Implications
TheconditionsfortheconvergenceofQSIassketchedinTheorem1,reliesonamartingaleargument.
Martingales are defined with respect to a filtration, which represents the information accumulated
over time. If measurement outcomes are contextual, the structure of this filtration becomes more
complex. The information gained from an outcome otis not just about the specific observable mea-
sured but also about the context. This is why the martingale assumptions of Theorem 1 require an
adapted filtration that records measurement contexts - because standard conditional independence
assumptions, often implicit in simpler martingale proofs, may not hold if the probability of future
outcomes depends on the context of past measurements in non-trivial ways. The ergodicity (C1) and
informational completeness (C2) conditions would also need to be interpreted in light of contextu-
ality. In essence, KS contextuality reflects the differences between classical and quantum ontology
- and classical and quantum models of computation. Its consequence is that any QAIXI would
need to adopt a more sophisticated model of reality than classical AIXI. It cannot assume that
the environment possesses a set of definite, non-contextual properties that are merely uncovered by
measurement. Instead, QAIXI must learn and operate in a world where measurement outcomes are
co-created by the interaction between the agent’s choice of measurement context and the quantum
system.
F Bell Non-Locality and No-Cloning
Beyond contextuality, other foundational quantum principles like Bell non-locality and the no-
cloning theorem impose significant constraints and offer unique characteristics to QAIXI compared
to its classical counterpart. We expand upon the dicussion above in the subsections below.
F.1 Bell Non-Locality
Bell’s theorem [6] demonstrates that quantum mechanics predicts correlations between spatially
separated systems (that were previously entangled) which cannot be explained by any theory based
on local hidden variables (LHVs). The implications for QAIXI are indicative of the differences
between quantum and classical environments. If the true environment Q⋆subsists in entangled
states and allowing QAIXI to perform measurements on these subsystems at space-like separation,
then QAIXI’s universal mixture ΞQ(Eq. (10)) must accommodate models Qthat are inherently
non-local:
1. Classical AIXI, relying on Solomonoff induction over classical Turing machines Msol, constructs
its universal prior ξU(Eq. (2)) from environments that are, by their classical nature, local. Such
a prior would assign zero probability to observing correlations that violate Bell inequalities
(e.g., the CHSH inequality).F. BELL NON-LOCALITY AND NO-CLONING 25
2. QAIXI, by summing over quantum environments Qsol, can, in principle, learn and adapt to a
non-local Q⋆. The term 2−KQ(Q)ρQ
E(a1:m)must include Qs whose ρQ
E(a1:m)can lead to Bell-
violating statistics upon appropriate measurements.
For example, consider a QAIXI agent designed with two components, Alice and Bob, who are
spatially separated.
(a) The environment Q⋆repeatedly sends Alice and Bob a pair of qubits in an entangled Bell state,
e.g.,|Ψ−⟩=1√
2(|01⟩ − |10⟩).
(b) At each cycle t, Alice receives a classical random bit x∈ {0,1}and Bob receives y∈ {0,1}
(these could be part of the agent’s internal state or from an external prompter, effectively part
of the action setup).
(c) Alice chooses a measurement setting Ax(e.g., measuring her qubit along one of two directions)
and obtains outcome oA∈ {+1,−1}. Bob similarly chooses Byand gets oB∈ {+1,−1}.
(d) The action for QAIXI could be at= (setting choice for Ax,setting choice for By), and the per-
ceptet= (oA, oB, rt). The reward rtcould be 1ifoA·oB= (−1)xy(CHSH game condition for
certain settings) and 0otherwise.
IfQ⋆is quantum, Alice and Bob can choose their measurement settings such that they win the
CHSH game with a probability that is impossible for any classical LHV strategy. A classical AIXI,
whose models ν∈ M solare constrained by LHV, would never be able to predict or achieve this
quantum level of success. QAIXI, with its quantum prior ΞQ, could learn to implement the optimal
quantum strategy and understand that Q⋆is non-local. The presence of non-local correlations
means that the percept et= (oA, oB, rt)contains components oAandoBthat are correlated in
a way not explainable by any shared information in their common past light-cone (beyond the
initial entanglement). This challenges classical notions of conditional independence typically used
in agent-based convergence proofs. It can also break the martingale structure assumed in Theorem
1 unless over non-local Qare accounted for. More detail can be found in literature on quantum
game theory [13,29,30]
F.2 No-Cloning Theorem and QAIXI’s Sample Complexity
The no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an identical copy of an arbitrary
unknown quantum state. This has consequences for how QAIXI can learn about its environment.
Learning Firstly, because percepts upon which QAIXI learning is based are QTC channels, the
no cloning theorem gives rise to differences in how QAIXI learning would occur:
1. When QAIXI performs an action at(especially if it’s a measurement) on the environment state
ρQ
E(a1:t), this interaction alters the state. The post-measurement state is different, and the
specific instance of ρQ
E(a1:t)is consumed in yielding the outcome ot.
2. Classical AIXI can, in principle, take a history h<tand test many hypothetical continuations
with a given model νwithout altering the data h<t. Classical information can be copied and
reused.
3. QAIXI cannot do this with quantum states. To know how Q⋆would have responded to a
different action a′
tfrom the exact same instance of ρ⋆
E(a1:t−1), is impossible. It would need Q⋆
to produce that state (or an identical one) again.26 E. Perrier
Sample Complexity This one-shot nature of quantum measurement on unknown states impacts
the sample complexity of learning by a QAIXI agent:
1. To distinguish between different hypotheses Qabout the environment, or to estimate the ex-
pectedoutcome/rewardfordifferentactions,QAIXIneedstoobservetheenvironment’sresponse
multiple times.
2. Since each observation of a specific state instance is unique and unrepeatable, QAIXI effectively
needs Q⋆to prepare a new instance of a comparable state for each piece of information it wants
to gather about a particular type of situation or action.
3. If QAIXI wants to learn the full characteristics of ρ⋆
E(a1:t)through measurements, it is per-
forming a form of quantum state tomography. Full tomography of an n-qubit state generally
requires a number of measurement settings and repetitions that scales exponentially with n.
While QAIXI’s goal is not necessarily full tomography but rather optimal action selection, its
ability to learn the relevant features of Q⋆is still constrained by the information extractable
per (unclonable) interaction.
4. As noted above, this means the learning rate is limited by state-preparation resources. If Q⋆
itself has computational costs or time delays associated with preparing states, this directly
translates into a slower learning rate for QAIXI in terms of real-time or computational steps of
Q⋆.
The informational completeness condition (C2) for Theorem 1 ensures that measurements are infor-
mative. However, no-cloning dictates that this information is gathered sequentially, one unclonable
sample at a time. The 1/tconvergence rate for relative entropy and O(t−1/2)for trace distance are
asymptotic statements about the number of interactions t. The practical time or resources needed to
achieve a certain level of accuracy will be higher in quantum scenarios where each sample is precious
and unrepeatable, compared to classical scenarios where data can be exhaustively analyzed. Bell
non-locality thus expands the class of environments QAIXI must consider beyond classical capabil-
ities, while the no-cloning theorem imposes a fundamental restriction on the efficiency with which
QAIXI can extract information from its quantum world, directly impacting its sample complexity
for learning.G. NOTATION 27
