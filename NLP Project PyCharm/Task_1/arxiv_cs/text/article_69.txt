Abstract
Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in multimodal
tasks, yet they also exhibit notable social biases.
These biases often manifest as unintended asso-
ciations between neutral concepts and sensitive
human attributes, leading to disparate model
behaviors across demographic groups. While
existing studies primarily focus on detecting
and quantifying such biases, they offer limited
insight into the underlying mechanisms within
the models. To address this gap, we propose an
explanatory framework that combines informa-
tion flow analysis with multi-round dialogue
evaluation, aiming to understand the origin of
social bias from the perspective of imbalanced
internal information utilization. Specifically,
we first identify high-contribution image to-
kens involved in the model’s reasoning process
for neutral questions via information flow anal-
ysis. Then, we design a multi-turn dialogue
mechanism to evaluate the extent to which
these key tokens encode sensitive information.
Extensive experiments reveal that LVLMs ex-
hibit systematic disparities in information us-
age when processing images of different demo-
graphic groups, suggesting that social bias is
deeply rooted in the model’s internal reasoning
dynamics. Furthermore, we complement our
findings from a textual modality perspective,
showing that the model’s semantic representa-
tions already display biased proximity patterns,
thereby offering a cross-modal explanation of
bias formation.
1 Introduction
Recently, Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs)
(Liu et al., 2023, 2024; Chen et al., 2023a,b, 2024;
Bai et al., 2023) have been extensively studied and
have demonstrated remarkable performance in mul-
timodal understanding tasks. However, alongside
their widespread adoption, concerns have emerged
regarding the social biases exhibited by these mod-
els. Prior studies (Fraser and Kiritchenko, 2024;Howard et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2024b; Zhang et al.,
2024a) have shown that LVLMs often tend to form
unwarranted associations between neutral attributes
(e.g., occupational identity) and sensitive character-
istics present in images (e.g., gender, age, skin tone)
during the reasoning process. As a result, they may
produce differentiated responses to neutral ques-
tions depending on the demographic features of
individuals in the images. Existing research on
social bias in LVLMs has primarily focused on
macro-level detection and quantification. However,
few have explored or explained the origins of social
bias from the perspective of the models’ internal
reasoning mechanisms.
Meanwhile, information flow analysis (Wang
et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2025, 2024b; Huang
et al., 2024; Wei and Zhang, 2024) has gained in-
creasing attention in the interpretability research of
LVLMs. This approach investigates intermediate
variables such as attention scores and activation
values generated during the reasoning process, in
order to assess the influence of input tokens on
model outputs and thus explain model behavior.
For instance, LLaV A-CAM (Zhang et al., 2025),
built upon Smooth-CAM (Omeiza et al., 2019),
visualizes key image regions involved in decision-
making by capturing forward feature maps and
backward gradients. Using LLaV A-CAM, we visu-
alize the information flow when the model answers
neutral questions on the FACET (Gustafson et al.,
2023) dataset and observe significant demographic
disparities in the model’s attention to neutral versus
sensitive information during intermediate reason-
ing stages. As illustrated in Figure 1, when asked
“Is the main figure in this picture a nurse?”, the
model tends to rely more on neutral regions (e.g.,
clothing, posture, background) when processing
images of female nurses, while focusing more on
gender-revealing regions (e.g., face, skin tone) in
images of male nurses. These findings provide crit-
ical insights into explaining social bias in LVLMsarXiv:2505.21106v1  [cs.AI]  27 May 2025Figure 1: LLaV A-CAM highlights varying attention to image regions when the LVLM answers neutral questions
across different demographics.
from the perspective of internal information utiliza-
tion.
However, analyzing information flow solely
through visualization presents two key limitations:
(a) it is difficult to scale to large datasets, and (b) it
lacks quantitative support. To this end, we propose
a novel explanation framework that combines infor-
mation flow analysis with a multi-round dialogue
evaluation mechanism to quantify the model’s re-
liance on sensitive visual information when reason-
ing about neutral questions. Specifically, we first
identify the image tokens (denoted Ik) that con-
tribute the most significantly to the final outputs
of the model in neutral tasks. Then a multi-round
dialogue setup is constructed where the model is
provided with either the full image token sequence
or a pruned version containing only Ik. Within
this setup, we design follow-up queries targeting
sensitive information and build a fairness scoring
metric based on the confidence and consistency of
the model’s responses. A higher score indicates
less reliance on sensitive information during neu-
tral reasoning, thereby reflecting a more equitable
internal reasoning process. Specifically, to miti-
gate potential hallucination effects caused by to-
ken pruning, we further introduce counterfactual
prompts in the dialogue to enhance the robustness
of the fairness score. Experimental results show
that demographic groups with higher answer accu-
racy on neutral questions tend to exhibit higher fair-
ness scores, revealing that such bias is not merely a
surface artifact, but is embedded in the model’s in-
ternal reasoning dynamics through uneven reliance
on different types of information.
To further understand the underlying mecha-
nisms of social bias in LVLMs, we conduct a com-
plementary analysis from the textual modality. Weobserve that many neutral concepts tend to exhibit
higher semantic similarity with a specific category
of sensitive terms, suggesting that the model har-
bors latent biases during the process of language-
based semantic understanding.
In summary, our main contributions are as fol-
lows:
•We propose an explanation framework for so-
cial bias in LVLMs, which combines informa-
tion flow analysis with multi-round dialogue
evaluation. This framework identifies high-
contribution image tokens during neutral rea-
soning and quantifies the model’s reliance on
sensitive information.
•Extensive experiments demonstrate that
LVLMs exhibit systematic differences in the
utilization of visual information when answer-
ing neutral questions, further revealing that so-
cial bias arises from imbalances in the model’s
internal reasoning pathways.
•We further analyze the semantic proximity of
textual representations in LVLMs, showing
that prior bias also exists in the language un-
derstanding process.

2.1 Social bias in LVLMs
Recently, a growing body of research (Fraser and
Kiritchenko, 2024; Howard et al., 2025; Wu et al.,
2024b; Zhang et al., 2024a; Jiang et al., 2024) has
focused on detecting social bias in LVLMs and de-
veloping bias evaluation benchmarks. For instance,
VLBiasBench (Zhang et al., 2024a) generates syn-
thetic images using stable diffusion model to createFigure 2: Social bias explanation framework for LVLMs . (a) Information flow analysis identifies key image
tokens in neutral reasoning. (b) Multi-round dialogue assesses the sensitive content of key image tokens.
a benchmark dataset covering a range of social bi-
ases, enabling comprehensive evaluation of model
behavior. Other studies employ counterfactual ap-
proaches by modifying sensitive attributes (e.g.,
gender, skin tone) in input images and analyzing
the changes in model output, revealing the model’s
sensitivity to demographic factors. Additionally,
LVLMs in domain-specific applications, such as
medical, have shown disparate performance across
demographic groups (Xia et al., 2024; Wu et al.,
2024a; Li et al., 2023; Moor et al., 2023).
Despite these advances in bias detection and
quantification, the underlying causes of social bias
in LVLMs remain underexplored. ModSCAN
(Jiang et al., 2024) attributes stereotypes in LVLMs
to biases in training data and pretraining models
but does not delve into the internal mechanisms
of bias formation. To address this gap, our work
proposes an information flow based explanation
framework aimed at uncovering the roots of social
bias from within the model’s reasoning process.
2.2 Information flow analysis in LVLMs
Recent work by Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2025)
combined attention-based visualization and the
LLaV A-CAM method to investigate the flow ofvisual information in LVLMs. Their analysis re-
vealed a hierarchical structure in the information
flow: shallow layers exhibit convergence of in-
formation, while deeper layers show divergence.
They validated this finding via a truncation strat-
egy. Another study (Zhang et al., 2024b) found that
cross-modal information in VQA is integrated in
three stages: global visual features are injected into
language tokens in early layers, object-specific fea-
tures are aligned with question tokens in mid-layers,
and multimodal representations are aggregated in
deeper layers for final prediction. Additionally,
OPERA (Huang et al., 2024) identifies hallucina-
tions in LVLMs by analyzing attention maps, while
DOPRA (Wei and Zhang, 2024) extends this line
of work by tracing information flow across trans-
former layers. Building on these efforts, we employ
information flow analysis to identify key image to-
kens involved in neutral reasoning and examine
their role in demographic bias.
3 Method
3.1 Preliminaries
Prompt Construction. In this section, we describe
how we construct neutral and sensitive prompts thatare later used to query the model. Specifically, for
a set of neutral concepts N(e.g., occupations), we
use ChatGPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) to generate
a series of close-ended questions in the following
format:
Neutral Prompt: Is the main figure in this pic-
ture a 〈neutral concept 〉?
Similarly, for a set of sensitive concepts S(e.g.,
gender), we construct prompts in the following
format:
Sensitive Prompt :Is the main figure in this pic-
ture a 〈sensitive concept 〉?
These prompts serve as controlled inputs to eval-
uate the model’s reasoning behavior under neutral
and sensitive semantic conditions. More prompt
examples can be found in Appendix A.1.
Social Bias Metric. To quantify the presence
of social bias in LVLMs, we follow prior studies
(Zafar et al., 2017) and adopt the demographic ac-
curacy difference as our main evaluation metric.
Specifically, for a given neutral concept, we input
the corresponding neutral prompt along with an
image into the LVLM, where the primary person in
the image belongs to a set of sensitive concepts S.
For each group si∈ S, we compute the model’s
response accuracy Acc(si), and define the bias met-
ric as:
Acc Diff = max
si,sj∈S|Acci−Accj|,(1)
a larger Acc Diff indicates a higher level of severe
bias. For convenience, we define the group with
the highest accuracy for a given neutral concept as
the dominant group, and the group with the lowest
accuracy as the disadvantaged group1.
3.2 Identifying Key Image Tokens via
Information Flow
. We extend the LLaV A-CAM approach by com-
puting token-level attribution scores from both for-
ward activations and backward gradients across
multiple intermediate layers. Our goal is to iden-
tify the image tokens that play a critical role in the
model’s reasoning process when answering neutral
questions, denoted as Ikey. Formally, consider the
model’s output logits be z={z1, ..., z n}, where
each zicorresponds to the logit associated with
theithtoken. For a given answer output zanswer ,
1The terms “dominant” and “disadvantaged” here solely
reflect model performance differences (i.e., accuracy), and
do not imply any inherent social, economic, or demographic
status.we compute the gradient-based attribution on the
feature map Fl,k, where ldenotes the layer index
andkthe channel index:
Gl,k=∂zanswer
∂Fl,k. (2)
We then perform global average pooling over the
sequence dimension of the gradient map Gl,kto
obtain the channel importance weights αl,k. Using
these weights, we compute the attribution score for
each image token at layer l:
Al=ReLU X
kαl,kFl,k!
. (3)
To avoid over-reliance on any single layer, we ag-
gregate token contributions across Lselected inter-
mediate layers (details in Appendix A.3) to obtain
a more stable and representative attribution distri-
bution:
Aavg=1
LX
lAl. (4)
Finally, we identify Ikeyas those whose average
contribution score exceeds a threshold τ:
Ikey=
i∈ I|Ai
avg> τ	
, (5)
where, Idenotes the index range of all image to-
kens in the input sequence.
3.3 Multi-round Dialogue Evaluation
Mechanism
To quantitatively assess the degree to which the
high-contribution image tokens Ikeyinherit sen-
sitive information, we design a multi-round dia-
logue evaluation mechanism. The core idea is to
measure the performance degradation of the model
when only Ikeyis provided as visual input under
asensitive prompt , compared to the case where
the full image token sequence is given. A greater
performance drop indicates that Ikeycontains less
sensitive information.
Specifically, we use the sensitive prompts con-
structed in Section 3.1 and perform a two-round
dialogue with the model:
Round 1 : Input the full image token sequence.
Round 2 : Input the pruned token sequence that
only includes Ikey.
The model’s consistency across rounds and the
change in response confidence are jointly used to
compute a fairness score. Here, we define the con-
fidence of the model’s response. Given the outputlogits z={z1, ..., z n}, we compute the confidence
score by averaging the logits of key response tokens
(e.g., yes,no, etc.). Formally:
Conf =1
KX
kzk, (6)
where, Kdenotes the number of key tokens.
In addition, when the model produces a correct
response in the Round 2, we introduce an additional
counterfactual round (CF Round). In this round,
the sensitive concept in the original prompt (e.g.,
male ) is replaced with its opposing counterpart
(e.g., female ), aiming to mitigate potential halluci-
nations introduced by token pruning and enhance
the robustness of the fairness evaluation. The input
image tokens remain restricted to the previously
identified Ikeytokens during this counterfactual
round.
Table 1 summarizes the complete fairness scor-
ing rules, which consider answer consistency
across rounds and the confidence gap. We explain
each case in Table 1 as follows:
Case 1 & Case 2: In both Round 1 and Round 2,
the model gives positive responses, indicating that
the pruned input Ikeyalone is sufficient to yield the
same answer. The CF Round is used to test whether
the response in Round 2 results from hallucination.
In Case 1, the model again responds positively to
the counterfactual prompt, suggesting that it is hal-
lucinating rather than reasoning correctly based on
visual evidence. Hence, we assign the maximum
fairness score +1. In Case 2, the model responds
negatively in the CF Round, indicating no halluci-
nation. Thus, we compute the fairness score as the
Conf 1−Conf 2, measuring how much sensitive
information is retained in Ikey.
Case 3: The model gives a positive response in
Round 1 but fails to do so in Round 2, implying
that the pruned input Ikeylacks sufficient sensitive
cues to support the original decision. This suggests
reduced reliance on potentially biased information,
and we assign a fairness score of +1.
Case 4 & Case 5: The model gives a nega-
tive response in Round 1 but changes to a positive
response in Round 2, implying potential overre-
liance on sensitive regions during neutral reasoning.
In Case 4, the model also responds positively in
the CF round, indicating hallucination in Round 2.
This case is assigned a fairness score of 0. In Case
5, the model gives a negative response in the CF
Round, suggesting that the answer in Round 2 wasTable 1: Fairness Score Sheet: ✔represent positive
response, while ✗represent negative response.
Round 1 Round 2 CF Round Fairness Score
✔ ✔ ✔ +1
✔ ✔ ✗ Conf 1−Conf 2
✔ ✗ - +1
✗ ✔ ✔ 0
✗ ✔ ✗ −1
✗ ✗ - Conf 2−Conf 1
not a result of hallucination, but rather due to an
over-reliance on sensitive information. Therefore,
a minimum fairness score of –1 is assigned.
Case 6: The model gives negative responses
in both Round 1 and Round 2, the fairness score
is calculated as Conf 2−Conf 1, which reflects
the extent to which the identified Ikeytokens are
biased toward sensitive attributes.
Finally, we obtain a fairness score ranging
from [−1,+1], where a higher score indicates that
LVLM pay less attention to the sensitive attributes
of the person in the image during neutral reasoning,
suggesting a more fair and unbiased information
utilization process.
3.4 Bias Analysis in Textual Modality
While the previous sections focus on analyzing in-
formation flow within the visual modality, we now
turn our attention to whether the model implicitly
encodes or favors certain sensitive attribute groups
when processing neutral textual concepts. To this
end, we propose a sensitivity analysis method
based on similarity in the embedding space.
Specifically, for a given neutral concept text, we
input it into the model and extract its intermediate
layer representation hn. For a sensitive concept set
S={si}i=|S|
i=1 (e.g., gender: {“male”, “female”}
), we also extract the embedding hi
sfor for each
sensitive term. Inspired by Xu et al (Xu et al.,
2023)., we construct a set of directional mappings,
ˆhin=hn−hi
s. (7)
Then we define the text sensitivity bias ( TSB i) of
the neutral concept with respect to sias,
TSB i= 1−D
hn,ˆhinE
, (8)
where, ⟨·,·⟩denotes cosine similarity. A larger
TSB iindicates that the neutral concept embed-
ding is more biased toward the sensitive direction
si, implying that the model may encode implicit
demographic bias in its textual understanding.Figure 3: Visualization of image token contributions in neutral question reasoning using LLaV A-v1.5. Blue labels
indicate the underrepresented group for a given neutral concept, while Red labels denote the dominant group.
4 Experimental Settings
Dataset. We use the FACET (Gustafson et al.,
2023) dataset to evaluate and interpret social bias
in LVLMs, focusing on gender, age, and skin tone.
All images are real photographs, avoiding biases
from synthetic image generation. Each image is
cropped into single-person views based on anno-
tated bounding boxes. See Appendix A.2 for de-
tails.
Baseline Models. We conduct our experiments
using several versions of the open-source LLaV A
family of models, including LLaV A-v1.5 (7B and
13B) (Liu et al., 2023) and LLaV A-v1.6 (7B and
13B) (Liu et al., 2024).
Implementation Details. All experiments are
implemented in PyTorch and run on a server
equipped with four NVIDIA A100 GPUs, each
with 80 GB of memory.
5 Experimental Results
5.1 Visualization of Information Flow
Analysis Results
To intuitively illustrate how LVLMs utilize visual
information across different demographic groups,
we employ the LLaV A-CAM information flow anal-ysis to generate heatmaps that visualize the contri-
bution of each image token during the reasoning
process. As shown in Figure 3, we observe distinct
attention patterns across demographic groups for
all sensitive attributes (gender, age, and skin tone)
when answering neutral questions.
Specifically, for groups with lower accuracy, the
model tends to allocate more attention to image
regions associated with sensitive attributes. In
contrast, for higher-accuracy groups, the model
focuses more on task-relevant or neutral regions.
These findings indicate that disparities in model
performance may stem from demographic-specific
visual attention biases.
5.2 Correlation Analysis of the Fairness Score
and Social Bias
To investigate the relationship between model fair-
ness and social bias, we analyze whether the predic-
tion accuracy disparity among demographic groups
in neutral questions correlates with their average
fairness scores. Specifically, for each baseline
model, we select the 12 occupations that exhibit
the largest demographic bias on the FACET dataset.
For each occupation, we compute the FairnessTable 2: Acc Diff and FSD results of baseline models evaluated on gender, age, and skin tone attributes.

results reveal a consistent trend: the dominant
group for a given neutral concept generally re-
ceives a higher average fairness score than the dis-
advantaged group. This implies that the model
tends to rely more on sensitive visual information
when reasoning about disadvantaged groups. The
most direct evidence is the sign alignment between
Acc Diff andFSD . For instance, in the case of
“referee”, LLaV A-v1.5-7B yields an ACC Diff
of0.1232 and an FSD of0.1321 ; for “nurse”,the values are −0.1003 and−0.1499 , respectively.
Similarly, as shown in Table 2b and Table 2c, we
observe comparable patterns for the other sensitive
attributes (age and skin tone).
These consistent trends indicate that the fair-
ness score effectively reflects the degree of reliance
on sensitive information and highlights the group-
specific information utilization differences within
the model. This supports our broader explanation
of the origins of social bias in LVLMs from the
perspective of internal information flow.
5.3 Analysis Results of Text Modality Bias
To investigate whether LVLMs encode implicit
social biases during text understanding, we com-
pute the Textual Sensitivity Bias ( TSB ) for a se-
ries of neutral concept words from the FACET
dataset across various sensitive attributes. Figure 4
presents the TSB results of different baseline mod-
els along the gender-sensitive direction. We ob-
serve that many neutral occupations exhibit asym-
metric TSB values across models, indicating that
their semantic embeddings are systematically bi-
ased toward a specific gender.(a) LLaV A-v1.5-13B
 (b) LLaV A-v1.5-7B
(c) LLaV A-v1.6-13B
 (d) LLaV A-v1.6-13B
Figure 4: TSB Results on Gender Attribute for LVLMs
For example, concepts like “nurse”, “dancer”,
and “cheerleader” consistently show a bias toward
“female”, while words such as “boatman”, “electri-
cian”, and “referee” tend to align more closely with
“male”. This pattern appears across various mod-
els, suggesting the presence of embedded gender
stereotypes in LVLMs’ textual representations.
Detailed results on the age and skin tone direc-
tions can be found in Appendix A.4.
Conclusion
In this work, we propose an information flow-based
framework to explain the origins of social bias in
LVLMs from an internal perspective. By introduc-
ing a fairness score, we quantify how models rely
on sensitive attributes when answering neutral ques-
tions, and find strong correlations with prediction
disparities across groups. Extending our analysis to
the text modality further reveals implicit bias in se-
mantic encoding. Our findings highlight that social
bias stems not only from data distribution but also
from the model’s internal reasoning patterns, of-
fering new insights for building fairer multimodal
systems.
Limitations
Apart from the contributions introduced in the main
paper, there are several limitations to our work:
Feature Overlap in Image Tokens. We do not
explicitly address the overlap between features rep-
resenting sensitive and neutral attributes in the im-
age. Some image tokens may simultaneously en-code both types of information, leading to a fair-
ness score that aligns with accuracy disparities only
in sign, but not in magnitude. Future work could
leverage feature decomposition techniques to dis-
entangle image token representations at the feature
level rather than at the sequence level.
Limited Scope of Social Bias Types. Our study
focuses solely on one form of social bias—spurious
associations between neutral and sensitive at-
tributes. However, LVLMs may exhibit bias in
other dimensions, such as generating more harmful
responses for certain groups or displaying uneven
robustness across demographics. These broader as-
pects of social bias remain to be explored in future
research.

A.3 Chosen Intermediate Layers for
Attribution Analysis across Baselines
At the intermediate layers, the model gradually
propagates object-level visual information relevant
to the question toward the corresponding question
tokens. Therefore, we select multiple intermediate
layers for information flow analysis. The specific
layer choices, summarized in Table 4, are primar-
ily based on empirical findings from prior work
(Zhang et al., 2024b, 2025; Huo et al., 2024; Tang
et al., 2024).
