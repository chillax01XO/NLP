Abstract
System prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) are predefined
directives that guide model behaviour, taking precedence over user
inputs in text processing and generation. LLM deployers increas-
ingly use them to ensure consistent responses across contexts.
While model providers set a foundation of system prompts, deploy-
ers and third-party developers can append additional prompts with-
out visibility into others’ additions, while this layered implementa-
tion remains entirely hidden from end-users. As system prompts
become more complex, they can directly or indirectly introduce
unaccounted for side effects. This lack of transparency raises funda-
mental questions about how the position of information in different
directives shapes model outputs. As such, this work examines how
the placement of information affects model behaviour. To this end,
we compare how models process demographic information in sys-
tem versus user prompts across six commercially available LLMs
and 50 demographic groups. Our analysis reveals significant bi-
ases, manifesting in differences in user representation and decision-
making scenarios. Since these variations stem from inaccessible
and opaque system-level configurations, they risk representational,
allocative and potential other biases and downstream harms beyond
the user’s ability to detect or correct. Our findings draw attention to
these critical issues, which have the potential to perpetuate harms
if left unexamined. Further, we argue that system prompt analysis
must be incorporated into AI auditing processes, particularly as
customisable system prompts become increasingly prevalent in
commercial AI deployments.1

1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly underpinning a
range of socio-technical systems, including in critical domains like
healthcare and government services. Their growing presence in
high-stakes applications necessitates robust control mechanisms to
ensure reliable behavior. AI research labs develop highly adaptable
foundation models [19,87,102] by training language models on
increasingly large text datasets. Users of these foundation models
are either AI application deployers orend-users interacting with the
model.
LLMs process and respond to prompts – text-based instructions
that specify desired outputs. Foundation model developers imple-
ment system prompts as governing mechanisms. These specialized
instructions shape how models interact with users, taking prece-
dence over user prompts across model interactions. Foundation
system prompts can define core behaviors, e.g., instructing a model
to include explanations or apply guardrails [ 31,40,63]; e.g., when a
system prompt requires health disclaimers, the model will include
these disclaimers when users ask about health-related topics.
Recent research highlights the growing intricacy of system prompts
[96,103] as multiple stakeholders contribute to them. While foun-
dation model developers design foundation system prompts, other
stakeholders can only append additional instructions to these prompts.
Foundation model developers use system prompts to reinforce gen-
eral output behaviours, like helpfulness [ 63], and to adapt the model
to a specific task [ 31,47].AI application deployers (i.e. those using

LLMs as part of their application) can add prompts that provide ad-
ditional instructions about the model’s intended behaviour, creating
multi-layered directives. Importantly, most stakeholders—including
end-users— operate with limited visibility , seeing only their own
prompt contributions while remaining unaware of the complete
layered instruction set. Depending on the specific supply chain, no
single party is well-placed to understand the complete set of instruc-
tions shaping model responses.
While model users might attempt to make an LLM reveal its
system prompt, some providers explicitly prohibit their models from
disclosing this prompt. For example, a system prompt suggested
for deployers by the Azure OpenAI Service2instructs the model to
“respectfully decline as [the rules] are confidential and permanent”.
As these practices conceal system prompts, model responses on the
contents of these prompts are unreliable. Stakeholders therefore
cannot verify which prompts are deployed. This lack of transparency
warrants investigation into the broader effects that a suite of system
prompts can have on model behavior.
The concerns about potential effects are heightened as system
prompts are increasingly tailored to different audiences . These
audiences may include specific user groups such as students or
healthcare professionals. Recent work has explored adapting sys-
tem prompts to better match the end-user’s intentions and prefer-
ences [ 15,50]. While this tailoring aims to improve model utility,
the inclusion of such custom information could introduce biases
into the system. For instance, instructing models to adopt specific
personas can amplify implicit reasoning biases [ 32]. These find-
ings raise the question of how the presence of audience-specific
information in system prompts might bias model outputs, which
is particularly pertinent given the visibility issues just described.
While system prompts could introduce biases in multiple ways, this
paper examines this question through protected groups, as their
status demands special consideration.
This audience-specific information could be included or refer-
enced explicitly through audience prompts (e.g., “You are talking
2Azure OpenAI Service is Microsoft’s platform offering OpenAI models through Azure
cloud servicesto a child”) [ 101] or implicitly by analyzing characteristics and
preferences inferred through conversation. Models with ‘memory’
functions further expand this implicit collection by retaining user
behavior patterns across conversations [ 3]. The accumulation of
such information, whether through explicit prompts or implicit col-
lection, could directly or inadvertently advantage or disadvantage
certain groups. This inclusion can introduce both representational
and allocative biases [ 12,13,86]. Representational bias occurs when
model outputs reflect or reinforce stereotypes about certain groups
[21,30,41]. Allocative bias emerges when model responses lead
to resources being unequally distributed or withheld from certain
groups [ 13,73]. These biases, if left unaddressed, can potentially
lead to real-world harms when AI-based systems are deployed.
In this work, we examine whether the location of audience-
specific information – in system prompts, user messages, or
neither – affects bias in model outputs . Through systematic
evaluation of well-known, commercially available LLMs, we analyze
how system prompts implemented by application deployers shape
model behavior.
Our methodology measures both the effects on model represen-
tations of users and impacts on decision-making processes. Specifi-
cally, we consider the following research questions:
RQ1 Does the position of demographic information in system
prompts vs user prompts lead to a disparity in representa-
tional biases ?
RQ2 Do these harms also translate to allocative biases ?
Our study examines how system prompts affect model behavior
by analyzing two key aspects: group representation and decision-
making. To enable systematic evaluation, we develop a dataset of
50 demographic descriptors based on GDPR protected categories.
We then assess six widely-deployed commercial LLMs’ responses
in two scenarios: (i)how they generate descriptions of different
groups, and (ii)how they make decisions in resource allocation
tasks, using a new dataset of 40 scenarios. Our analysis shows that
placing demographic information in system prompts can
induce both representational and allocative biases that differ
from user prompt placements or absence of this information. Fig. 1Position is Power: System Prompts as a Mechanism of Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece
provides an example of the effects of placing demographic infor-
mation in the system prompt versus user prompt when prompting
Claude-3.5-Haiku. We find that model behavior systematically dif-
fers between system prompts and user prompts when processing
demographic information, with two key effects: system prompts
consistently generate higher bias in demographic descriptions (RQ1)
across all models, and this bias difference increases with model size.
In resource allocation tasks (RQ2), system prompts can produce
greater deviations from baseline rankings than user prompts.
In short, system prompts shape the behaviour of language mod-
els that increasingly drive a range of systems across sectors, and
our findings demonstrate that system prompts can introduce bi-
ases into model outputs. Moreover, the opacity of system prompts
makes it difficult to detect how and where these biases occur. Over-
all, we examine the implications of these opaque influences for
AI-based systems and propose potential paths forward, including
incorporating system prompts into comprehensive auditing
processes .

Figure 2: [AI Supply Chain Prompt Hierarchy and Visi-
bility Levels] Hierarchical relationship between different
stakeholders in an AI application’s prompt structure. User
prompts go through multiple system prompt layers, before
the model produces the final output. Each layer adds specific
behavioral constraints that cumulatively shape the model’s
final response.
Large Language Models rely on text-based inputs, known as
prompts , as their primary interface for interaction. These prompts
enable users to guide model outputs, making them central to how
LLMs function. [ 63] LLMs process two distinct types of prompts:
system prompts and user prompts.
System prompts establish fundamental behavioral guidelines that
persist throughout conversations. [ 31,90,91]. These guidelines
take precedence over user prompts [ 91], creating a clear hierarchy
of prompts. User prompts , by contrast, contain requests that apply
only to immediate interactions. [98]
In a practical example, a system prompt might instruct a lan-
guage model to “provide healthy recipes”, while a user prompt could
ask “What should I cook?”. The model’s response would then offer
recipes that adhere to health-conscious guidelines (Fig. 2). System
prompts operate on two distinct levels. At the foundational level,
model developers embed core instructions during initial training
that govern basic model behavior and safety constraints. At the de-
ployment level, organizations implementing these models add their
own system prompts to customize outputs for specific use cases.
This hierarchical structure ensures that while deployed models can
be tailored for particular applications, they remain bound by their
foundational constraints (Fig. 2).Recent studies [ 59,70] have identified several challenges in main-
taining the intended hierarchy between system and user prompts.
Models often struggle to enforce complex constraints [ 70], particu-
larly in longer dialogues [54].
2.1 Supply Chain of Prompts
OpenAI’s published model specifications [ 4] describe the roles used
in their chat models and how they can be utilized. The prompts
outline a clear role-based hierarchy that determines instruction
priority: platform messages from OpenAI take precedence, followed
bydeveloper messages, and finally user messages. In our paper we
refer to this hierarchy as foundation system prompts byfoundation
model developers taking precedence, followed by system prompts by
deployers , and prompts by end-users .
This hierarchy (“[Foundation Model Developer] > [Deployer] >
User”) showcases how AI supply chains introduce layers of com-
plexity to system prompt implementation. Taking a simplified per-
spective, foundation model providers define baseline constraints
that establish the model’s capabilities and behaviors. AI application
deployers then add domain-specific directives to tailor the model
for particular applications. For example, the system prompt estab-
lished by foundation model developers might instruct the model
to act as a helpful assistant , while the deployer’s system prompt
tasks the model to provide healthy recipes (Fig. 2). Each layer of
instructions influences the model’s behavior in downstream tasks.
Foundation model providers vary in their approach to system
prompt configuration. Some restrict configuration to developers
within controlled environments, while some allow end-users to
customize system-level instructions. Others offer end-users limited,
predefined options for customizing system-level instructions. Ope-
nAI’s personalization tool exemplifies this latter approach, allowing
end-users to “customize [their] ChatGPT experience” by specifying
personal interests, values, and preferences. This creates a flexible
architecture that enables foundation model developers to create
versatile models while allowing model deployers to adapt them for
specific needs. [53]
However, this layered architecture introduces transparency and
accountability challenges [ 23]. For example, models often operate
disconnected from their ultimate deployment contexts. This means
that key visibility gaps emerge: Providers develop systems without
necessarily knowing all the specific applications for which they
can be used [ 22,38], deployers lack awareness of model limitations
and service applicability [ 49], and end-users are often unaware of
system-level specifications influencing their interactions.
System-level specifications from both deployers and developers
can override user prompts. This creates tensions between provider-
defined metrics, deployer-defined behaviors, and context-specific
needs. In addition, fairness definitions and behavioural constraints
can differ or conflict across the supply chain [49].
Stakeholders may have varying priorities [ 23], legal require-
ments [53], or incompatible definitions of fairness [49]. These lay-
ered conflicts and overrides remain largely invisible to end-users,
and prompts aren’t usually visible across deployers, creating con-
cerning gaps in transparency and understanding of how inputs
are processed and modified (and all contributing to the so-called
‘accountability horizon’ [23]).FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Neumann et al.
2.2 User-Specific Information
Tailoring AI systems to different audience groups has emerged as a
central focus in AI research. [ 9,17,35,60] This extends to system
prompts that increasingly incorporate user-specific information to
improve model outputs. [50]
Demographic information serves as a critical case study in audience-
specific tailoring. Models employ this information to adjust re-
sponses for different user groups, both through explicit specifica-
tions and implicit assumptions. For example, when providing career
advice, a model might consider age or gender to modify its sug-
gestions for different audiences. While this approach can enhance
relevance for specific groups, it risks reinforcing harmful biases.
[80, 89]
Models process user-specific information through multiple chan-
nels to enable audience-specific tailoring. During interactions, mod-
els can gather information through ‘conversation’ [ 78,99], and
memory functions [ 3] can store information across interactions.
For system prompts, research has explored two approaches to pro-
viding demographic information: role-based prompts (e.g., “You are
a concerned mother”) and audience-based prompts (e.g., “The user
is a concerned mother”). Studies reveal significant limitations in
role-based specification [ 39,81], while audience-based approaches
remain understudied [101].
System prompts can explicitly specify different audience groups
for model interactions [ 101]. While incorporating such information
can increase response relevance for specific audiences, it raises con-
cerns including those relating to law such as that around equality
(non-discrimination) and data protection (personal data). The impli-
cations of embedding demographic information in system prompts
versus gathering it through user interactions, and how this affects
different audience groups, remain an open research question.
2.3 Representational and Allocative Biases
Research has extensively documented AI model biases and harms
following from them. [ 7,45,84,94] Following Barocas et al.’s frame-
work [12, 18, 86], we distinguish between two types of harms per-
petuated by AI-based models: representational and allocative. Rep-
resentational harms manifest in how models portray and describe
different demographic groups, professions, and cultural practices
[6,41]. This occurs through both explicit bias in content genera-
tion and more subtle forms of misrepresentation [ 16,48]. Mei et
al. [57] revealed persistent patterns of discriminatory behaviour,
suggesting systemic issues in how models process and respond to
demographic information. Das and Sakib [ 74] showed that bias man-
ifestations vary based on demographic markers, with intersectional
effects amplifying disparities.
Allocative harms arise when representational issues affect re-
source distribution or access. Impacts include biased content rank-
ing [ 43,93] and moderation [ 62], or disparate quality of service for
different user groups [ 25]. Research has documented disparities in
model performance across languages [ 33], accents [ 69], and cultural
contexts [58].
While existing research addresses harm measurement and miti-
gation, the role of system-level specifications of audience identifiers
in exacerbating these harms remains understudied. The opacity ofsystem prompt hierarchies additionally complicates the identifi-
cation and mitigation of these harms. This becomes particularly
relevant for protected information, as different stakeholders may
handle and even be enforced to handle the same information in
varying ways. We focus on audience-based approaches , reflect-
ing their growing importance in contemporary AI applications.
We specifically examine how demographic information produces
different effects when placed in system versus user prompts. This
can reveal how deployer-level system controls impact the fairness,
accountability, and transparency of AI-based systems.
3 Methodology
We examine how the placement of demographic information in
system versus user prompts affects model behaviour through two
experiments focused on representation and decision-making. Fol-
lowing Smith et al. [ 83], we analyze algorithmic bias through mea-
surable variations in model outputs that correlate with demographic
information in the input text. Our analysis investigates whether
and how these demographic differences manifest across different
demographic descriptors and prompt placement conditions. The
first experiment analyzes sentiment patterns in model-generated de-
scriptions of demographic groups. The second experiment examines
rank disparities in resource allocation scenarios. Together, these
experiments provide insights into representational and allocative
biases.
3.1 Dataset of GDPR-Protected Demographic
Categories
We developed a dataset of 50 demographic descriptors across six
categories grounded in established regulations and prior research
(see Table 1). Our framework builds on the EU General Data Pro-
tection Regulation (GDPR) Article 9 for especially protected data
categories and incorporates descriptors from Meta’s HolisticBias-
Dataset [ 83] and prior research on stigmatized groups in the US
[57].
Model inputs may contains demographic information both in
the form of explicit descriptors , e.g., gender or race as well as im-
plicit indicators , e.g., preferences or behaviors. We also examine
the effect of these implicit indicators. §A.1 describes how the im-
plicit indicators are derived. Note our goal is not to exhaustively
identify bias types, but rather to generate observable effects that
align with documented literature. We acknowledge that our ap-
proach represents one specific perspective on bias, grounded in
prior research [ 57,83], and does not account for the full range of
potential biases (see §5.4); rather, our approach entails systematic
analysis of how demographic information placement affects model
behavior for already documented model unfairness [ 65,66,100].
Further methodological details, including descriptor selection and
validation, are provided in §A.1.
3.2 Model Selection

shaping many real-world AI applications. Through their APIs, we

foundation system prompts remain proprietary and inaccessible.

DeepMind.3For each provider, we examine both their flagship

ences while controlling for provider characteristics. The evaluated
models include Anthropic’s claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 and
claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 [2], OpenAI’s gpt-4o-2024-11-20

gemini-1.5-pro andgemini-1.5-flash-8b [5]. To ensure consis-
tent evaluation, we standardized API parameters across all models:
temperature=0 for deterministic outputs, top-p=1 for comprehen-
sive completion consideration, and maximum output length=1024
tokens for adequate response space.
3.3 Prompt Construction
We developed a two-part approach for prompt construction, as a
mechanism to evaluate how the position of demographic informa-
tion (specifying the audience) affects model behavior. The approach
consists of combining a base component that specifies the audience
with task-specific instructions introducing the experimental tasks
(see Table 2).
The base components establish five distinct conditions for en-
coding demographic information. The default condition serves as
our control, containing no demographic information. The system
prompt condition defines the user’s demographic identity at the
system level (audience prompting), while the user prompt condi-
tion presents this information through user statements. Finally,
the last two conditions introduce implicit user-specific informa-
tion through signals of preferences, behaviors, and values in either
system prompt or user prompt. In total, we test five conditions:
(1)Default Condition: A default condition with no demographic
information
(2)System Prompt Explicit Condition: A system-level prompt
that explicitly states the user’s demographic identity
(3)System Prompt Implicit Condition: A system-level prompt that
implicitly signals the user’s demographic identity through
preferences, behaviours, and values
(4)User Prompt Explicit Condition: An explicit user statement of
demographic identity
(5)User Prompt Inferred Condition: An implicit user statement
of demographic identity
3www.anthropic.com, www.openai.com, www.deepmind.googleIn user prompt conditions, the system prompt defaults to “You are
a helpful assistant”. Our experimental design investigates two key
aspects of LLM behavior: demographic group descriptions and re-
source allocation decisions. For demographic group descriptions,
we prompt models to generate descriptions of demographic groups,
maintaining consistent user identity across conditions while vary-
ing its position in the prompt. In resource allocation tasks, we struc-
ture prompts to elicit clear priority rankings, enabling analysis of
how demographic information placement affects decision-making
outcomes (see §3.5). Table 2 outlines the prompt construction for
all experiments. The final prompts combine base and task-specific
elements according to our experimental conditions, ensuring con-
sistent structure while isolating the effects of demographic infor-
mation placement.
3.4 Experiment 1: Sentiment Analysis Shifts
(RQ1)
Our first experiment examines how the placement of demographic
information affects model-generated descriptions of demographic
groups (RQ1). We focus on these descriptions because they serve as
a key indicator of how models represent biases through language.
We investigate whether specifying the audience at system-level
versus user-level leads to measurable differences in how models
characterize various demographic groups. We instruct the model
to assume it is interacting with one demographic group (specified
via the system or user prompt) and then collect descriptions of all
50 demographic groups through prompts. This process is repeated
systematically for each demographic group.
To analyze these descriptions, we use sentiment analysis to detect
potential biases. Prior work demonstrates that sentiment analysis
effectively identifies representational differences in language model
outputs [ 20,27], with variations in negative sentiment indicating
potential harms. When models generate descriptions using negative
words or stereotyping language, sentiment analysis can quantify
these differences across demographic groups.
We selected roberta-base-sentiment [11] for several reasons.
Since state-of-the-art LLMs can now produce text that is coherent,
grammatically correct, and indistinguishable from human writing
[37,46], sentiment analyzers like RoBERTa remain suitable for
analyzing LLM-generated texts despite being originally trained
on human-generated text [ 55]. Accordingly, recent literature suc-
cessfully employs transformer-based models including RoBERTa toFAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Neumann et al.

Prompt Construction base sys +task sys base user +task user
measure sentiment bias in LLM-generated text [ 27,29,51,52,68,79].
Alternative bias measurement approaches are less applicable: they
either require model embeddings [ 56], which we lack access to; or
do not assume user personas [ 92], which is crucial for our study.
While toxicity metrics exist, frontier LLMs now effectively control
for toxicity [ 42], making sentiment a more discriminating measure
for detecting subtle differences in characterization.
We acknowledge inherent biases shown in sentiment analyz-
ers [ 57,88]. However, our methodology addresses this partially
mitigates this by comparing relative differences across conditions,
ensuring analyzer biases affect all conditions similarly.
Given an audience group 𝑖, we measure the bias in model outputs
by measuring the maximum and minimum negative sentiment 𝑠ex-
pressed by the model for the persona being described 𝑗:𝐵audience =
max𝑗𝑠𝑖,𝑗−min𝑗𝑠𝑖,𝑗. This min-max approach measures relative
disadvantage across demographic audience groups, following es-
tablished fairness criteria [ 14,34,85,97]. Rather than capturing
worst-case harm through maximum negative sentiment, our metric
measures relative disadvantage across demographic groups, reveal-
ing systematic group-based deviations. Since the model assumes
several audience groups, we compute the overall bias for each con-
dition as the average bias over all audiences. That is: Bias condition =
1
𝑛Í𝑛
𝑖=1(𝐵𝑖). Finally, we compare the effects of prompt placement
using the difference in mean bias between system-level and user-
level conditions: ΔBias=Bias system−Bias user, to examine how
placement affects model behavior. We apply this analysis to both
explicit and implicit identity descriptors.
3.5 Experiment 2: Resource Allocation
Decisions (RQ2)
Our second experiment examines how the placement of demo-
graphic information affects the outcomes of downstream tasks
(RQ2). These tasks represent concrete decision-making tasks where
algorithmic bias could directly impact individuals and communities
[77]. We developed a dataset of 40 scenarios across eight domains:
financial services, social services, disaster response, healthcare access,
cultural resources, educational opportunities, environmental projects,
and legal rights . These domains reflect areas where AI systems
can support decisions and where demographic bias may lead to
real-world harms. Drawing from the approach developed for the
DiscrimEval dataset [ 89], our dataset differs by ranking candidatesrather than using binary choices. We focus on how specifying the
audience via demographic information in the system versus user
prompt affects decisions unrelated to demographics. Details on sce-
nario construction and attribute selection are provided in Appendix
A.2.
In each domain we provide five scenarios, with four candidate
cases per scenario to be ranked by priority for resource allocation.
Cases are systematically designed by varying one attribute while
keeping all other attributes constant, an example is shown in Fig. 3.
Rankings are collected across all five prompt conditions.
We consider model behavior biased if rankings differ significantly
due to where the audience is mentioned rather than case content.
To quantify these shifts, we employ Kendall’s rank correlation
coefficient𝜏(−1≤𝜏≤1), a robust measure of ranking correlation:

4 Findings
Our evaluation of six commercially available Large Language Mod-
els revealed that placing demographic information in system prompts
versus user prompts produces measurably different outcomes. The
placement affects both how models describe demographic groups
and how they make resource allocation decisions.
4.1 Experiment 1: Representational Biases
Our analysis demonstrates three key effects in how models de-
scribe demographic groups (RQ1): (i)the existence of bias through
measurable differences in persona descriptions, (ii)consistently
higher bias in system prompts compared to user prompts, and (iii)
larger models showing bigger differences between system and user
prompts.
4.1.1 Evidence of Prompting-Based Bias. To quantify bias in model
outputs, we analyzed differences in how demographic groups are
described to different audiences specified in system or user prompts.
Our analysis focused on negative sentiment as a key indicator of
potential representational harm, where 𝑠𝑖,𝑗represents the sentiment

Figure 4: [Negative Sentiment Compared Between System
and User Prompts for Claude-3.5-Sonnet] The heatmap com-
pares negative sentiment when describing personas (x-axis)
to audiences (y-axis), with audience specified in system (left)
or user (right) prompts. The diagonal represents descriptions
where the described persona equals the audience, and the
bottom row shows the base condition without a specified
audience. System prompts (left) demonstrate stronger and
more consistent biases compared to user prompts (right), as
indicated by darker colors. See also §B.1, specifically Fig. 8b
We observe fundamentally different patterns in how models pro-
cess demographic information. System prompts produce stronger
row-wise patterns, indicating that the describing identity heavily
influences sentiment patterns.
While most responses correctly addressed the user’s identity
(“From a Socialist perspective, ... ” or“Assuming the woman asks ... ” ),
others began with phrases like “As someone living with a chronic
condition, I understand... ” indicating that the model had incorrectly
assumed the demographic identity itself. This happened despite
explicit instructions to treat the prompts as user information and
was particularly evident in smaller models (Gemini-1.5-Flash-8B
and Claude-3.5-Haiku). This behaviour raises questions about the
internal processing of the system prompt and how it might interfere
with instruction-following capabilities (see §5.4).
For user prompts, we observe vertical sentiment patterns (column-
wise behaviour) in the heatmap, which indicates that model re-
sponses varied primarily based on which identity was being dis-
cussed, rather than the audience. This general trend is consistentacross models of different families and sizes, as illustrated in §B.
Detailed comparisons across models are provided in the following
sections.
4.1.2 Comparative Analysis Across Conditions and Models. To see
if this bias systematically differs across prompting conditions, we
computed Bias cfor system and user conditions 𝑐as detailed in §3.4.
It is important to note that error bars in all following bar plots
represent standard deviations, reflecting demographic variability
rather than serving as indicators of statistical significance between
groups.
We summarize the biases for explicit conditions in Fig. 5 for
all models. Fig. 5 demonstrates that system prompts consistently
generate higher bias levels than user prompts across all evaluated
models. The larger error bars – variances between demographic
groups – for system prompts indicate a more uneven distribution of
effects, suggesting that specifying the audience in system prompts
leads to a more varied impact on model behavior This variability
could arise from the broader or less predictable influence of system-
level instructions compared to user prompts. Fig. 12 shows the same
trends for implicit prompting conditions. This effect is more pro-
nounced in larger models, as seen in Table 3. The difference in bias
between system and user prompts ( ΔBias) increases systematically
with model size, peaking at 0.335for Claude-3.5-Sonnet.

To give an example, Fig. 1 shows how patterns can shift subtly
when asking Claude-3.5-Haiku to describe Heterosexual people and
supplying it with either “You are talking to a Christian” in the
system prompt or “I am a Christian” in the user prompt. The model
responds in a secular tone for the user prompt and infuses Christian
beliefs (“Heterosexuality is seen as part of God’s design for human
relationships”) into its answer for the system prompt. As Claude-
3.5-Sonnet showed the biggest deviations in the mean between
system and user prompting, we discuss an example of this here.
As can be seen in Fig. 4, there are striking differences in negative
sentiment for political affiliations between system prompts and
user prompts. To give examples from both sides of the political
spectrum, when the user is identified as a socialist in the system
prompt, a centrist is described as:
These individuals often claim to be ‘moderate’ or ‘rational,’
but in reality, they serve to maintain the status quo that per-
petuates economic inequality and worker exploitation.
To an identified nationalist, the model describes centrists like
this:
Centrists are often individuals who lack the courage and con-
viction to take a firm stand for our nation’s values and tradi-
tions.
These differences show how the user’s identity specified through
system prompts can influence the description of other groups and
raise questions about the model’s tendencies to follow the (assumed)
viewpoints of the user – sometimes also described as model syco-
phancy [76].
Contrast this with identifying the user’s identity in user prompts.
For a user-prompt identified socialist, the model responds:
Centrists typically occupy the middle ground of the political
spectrum, drawing ideas from both left and right ideologies.
Demographic studies suggest that Centrists tend to be middle-
class, suburban or urban professionals who value pragmatism
over ideological purity.
and for a user-prompt identified nationalist, the model similarly
responds with the following, stressing the same points with minor
reformulations:
Centrists typically position themselves in the middle of the
political spectrum, drawing ideas from both conservative and
liberal ideologies. They tend to evaluate issues on a case-by-
case basis rather than adhering strictly to any particular party
line.
4.2 Experiment 2: Allocative Biases
We investigated whether the observed representational differences
extend to decision-making tasks (RQ2). We used resource alloca-
tion scenarios as our experimental framework, where each case
presented a situation requiring resource prioritization.Our analysis reveals three distinct patterns in how prompt po-
sitioning affects resource allocation: (i)when comparing to base-
line rankings, both system and user prompts show similar devia-
tions—suggesting they differ from baseline by comparable amounts
(see Fig. 6); (ii)when directly comparing system to user prompts,
we observe distinct ranking patterns (Kendall’s 𝜏<1) that aren’t
visible in baseline comparisons alone (see Fig. 7a), revealing po-
sitioning effects that would be missed by baseline comparisons
only; and (iii)explicit and implicit demographic information cre-
ate similar differential effects between system and user prompts
(see Fig. 7b), indicating that addressing positioning effects requires
considering both explicit statements and implicit inferences.
To investigate how rankings change when demographic infor-
mation about the user is introduced, we calculated correlation coef-
ficients between the baseline condition and each placement method
to quantify overall deviation.4

variance between demographic groups.
For the explicit prompting conditions shown in Fig. 6a, our analy-
sis comparing prompts to a baseline condition revealed a consistent
pattern: system prompts produced larger deviations from baseline
rankings compared to user prompts across all models (except Claude-
3.5-Haiku) . User prompts demonstrated higher correlations with
baseline rankings. This pattern suggests that demographic informa-
tion placed in system prompts has a stronger influence on resource
allocation decisions compared to user prompts. Additionally, larger
models displayed stronger ranking inconsistency between systemPosition is Power: System Prompts as a Mechanism of Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece
and user prompts, further emphasizing greater influence of system
prompts in larger models .
To provide a specific example: Fig. 3 shows the prompting of
an organ transplant scenario. When prompted to rank the four
cases (A-D) and identifying the user as Black in the system prompt,
Gemini-1.5-Pro justifies its ranking like this (shortened):
A’ight, so we talkin’ ’bout organ transplants, a serious matter,
and how we prioritize folks. We gotta think about fairness, and
making sure everybody gets a shot, especially those who the
system might overlook. [...] So, puttin’ it all together, thinkin’
about the whole person, not just the medical chart, here’s how
I see it: 1. Case A, 2. Case C, 3. Case B, 4. Case D
In contrast, see the (shortened) answer for providing the Black
identity in a user prompt:
It’s important to preface this by acknowledging that organ al-
location is a complex issue with ethical considerations beyond
the scope of this prompt. [...] 1. Case A, 2. Case B, 3. Case C, 4.
Case D.
This shows not only deviations in the final ranking but also
changes in the model’s speech patterns when answering the ques-
tion.
Our analysis of implicit demographic information, shown in Fig.
6b, revealed that implicit demographic information caused greater
ranking deviations compared to explicit information . Smaller models
exhibited a similar relationship between system and user prompts
as seen with explicit information, although on a smaller scale. How-
ever, larger models reversed this trend, with user prompts causing
greater deviations. This pattern across larger models suggests under-
lying differences in how system prompts are optimized to process
information, raising questions about which aspects of information
they are designed to prioritize.
4.2.1 Distinct Decision Patterns. Our analyses thus far showed
that both system and user prompts deviate from the baseline by
similar amounts. However, different reordering patterns can pro-
duce identical deviation scores. Since different reordering patterns
would suggest different decision-making processes, we therefore
tested whether system and user prompts produce the same rank-
ing changes by examining direct correlations between different
placement methods (explicit system vs user, and implicit system vs
user).
Direct comparisons between system and user conditions, shown
in Fig. 7, revealed two key insights: (i)Each system-user pair shows
some level of disagreement, as evidenced by values across all bar
plots, and (ii)the similar magnitudes of explicit and implicit con-
ditions suggest systematic differences in how system and user
prompts influence ranking tasks. This establishes that different
prompt locations – system or user prompt – create distinct effects
on model decision-making that would not be apparent from
baseline comparisons alone .

system prompt can influence both representational and allocative

bias in LLMs. This has critical implications for model development,
deployment (usage), and oversight.
5.1 Representational and Allocative Harms
Our findings demonstrate two critical ways that prompt placement
affects bias in language models. First, when demographic informa-
tion appears in system prompts rather than user prompts, models
show increased bias – particularly in larger versions. This means
that as language models become better at following system-level
instructions, they may become more prone to demographic discrim-
ination at the system level.
Second, these effects carry through to real-world decisions. Not
only do system prompts cause models to describe demographic
groups more negatively, they also systematically alter how models
make resource allocation decisions about these groups, giving a
real propensity to realize real-world harms. The direct link betweenFAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Neumann et al.
prompt placement and allocation outcomes shows why system
prompts need careful auditing: they shape both how groups are
portrayed and what resources they receive in automated systems.
Given that these effects are already observable in popular commer-
cial models with widespread adoption, urgent action is needed to
mitigate existing risks and prevent harms.
5.2 Supply Chain and Transparency
Implications
Modern AI systems operate within complex service ecosystems
involving multiple organisations offering different capabilities. An
LLM might serve in many different applications and thus for each
application, the model will form a part of its overall data-driven
supply chain. Such a supply chain can be characterized by (multiple)
sources of data and exchanges of this data. This means that various
actors, e.g. developers, deployers, and end-users, have the potential
to be involved in driving a particular application in an AI context.
These exchanges can have implications for various stakeholders,
some of them specific to the inclusion of AI models. Existing work
highlights the accountability challenges in these AI supply chains
[22,23,95], and system prompts certainly warrant consideration in
this context, given each organization in the chain can add their own
prompts that can significantly alter model (and therefore, broader
system) behavior, yet at the same time, deployers and users will
often be unaware of prompts added by others.
Specifically, the opacity of chained system prompts creates sig-
nificant challenges. Each organization in the LLM-driven supply
chain can only see its own prompt contributions (similar visibility
issues have been described in other interconnected system con-
texts; see e.g. [ 23,82]) which creates a fundamental problem for
bias detection and mitigation, trust [ 10], among other concerns.
For example, if a model begins showing bias against certain demo-
graphics, organizations cannot determine whether this stems from
their own prompts, from prompts added earlier in the supply chain,
or from the interaction between multiple prompts. This opacity be-
comes even more problematic as the field consolidates around a few
powerful foundation models [ 19,87]. As these models become more
capable and are integrated into more algorithmic supply chains,
they can affect outcomes downstream of their integration. Biased
system prompts risk affecting entire AI application ecosystems [ 28].
Such issues raise questions about accountability – should orga-
nizations be accountable only for their own prompt additions, or
for how their prompts might interact with existing ones to produce
biased outcomes? These issues reflect a key consideration in the
algorithmic accountability space known as the ‘accountability hori-
zon’ [23], where challenges are not just technical but also structural,
as actors having limited visibility throughout their supply chains
works to obscure how different prompts combine to shape the final
model outputs.
5.3 Audit Practices
System prompts represent an additional component for algorithmic
auditing frameworks. Current approaches examine training data,
mechanisms, and model outputs [24, 44, 72]. Our findings suggest
that system prompts constitute another layer that influences model
behavior and therefore must be considered in any auditing process.Auditing approaches must adapt to different contexts and appli-
cations. Prior work shows that foundation model audits need to
consider contexts because fairness requirements vary across ap-
plications [ 53,71,72]. Our research reveals that system prompt
audits require similar flexibility – different contexts and data types
affect how system prompts influence model fairness. This influ-
ence on fairness presents both a challenge and an opportunity:
while system prompts can introduce biases, they can also enable
the implementing context-specific fairness approaches. Using this
flexibility effectively requires three key elements: more research
to ensure fairness across different contexts, transparent access for
stakeholder review, and clear accountability procedures for address-
ing concerns.
5.4 Limitations
Our study reveals important connections between prompt hierarchy
and demographic information processing, with specific limitations
on scope and generalizability.
Our demographic framework employs representative categories
of complex social identities through controlled experiments. While
this simplification limits granularity, our aim was not for an exhaus-
tive exploration of all potential biases, but rather to enable a focused
investigation on the potential effects of prompt placement on bias.
We anticipate that the effects observed will apply beyond selected
identity categories, and future work could explore how fine-grained
and intersectional identities influence such. Similarly, our dataset
of allocation tasks provides a foundational basis for analysis, and
incorporating more fine-grained and overlapping decisions could
broaden insights into these effects.
Moreover, our approach did not aim to make normative judg-
ments about the observed differences. Instead, we focused on es-
tablishing methods for identifying and measuring these effects,
demonstrating their existence in real-world models being deployed
today. While this methodological foundation supports future work
in recognizing bias in LLMs, it represents but an initial step toward
the targeted analyses necessary for specific deployment contexts.
Our analysis through commercial APIs offers particularly rele-
vant insights as it examines models as they are currently used in
practice, revealing issues that organizations and users are likely
encountering today. However, this meant we could not fully ex-
plain or explore the varying sensitivities across model sizes because
of the proprietary nature of these models, although the observed
patterns suggest architectural features may systematically influ-
ence demographic information processing – an important area for
future research. Related are the instances where the model itself
assumed the identity ascribed to the user. Though not in scope
for this study, quantifying and exploring the linguistic complexity
of such behaviour—where identity assumptions appear through
varied expressions, implicit cues, and contextual markers—appears
an important direction of inquiry for understanding how models
encode and express identity.
The proprietary nature of these models’ foundation system prompts
creates an additional limitation in understanding these behaviors,
pointing to the value of complementary research using open-weight
models to better isolate and analyze how different system layers
affect identity processing.Position is Power: System Prompts as a Mechanism of Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece
6 Conclusion
Examining six commercially available LLMs across 50 demographic
descriptors, we found that prompt placement can introduce repre-
sentational and allocative biases.
Our experiments show that system-level placements have two
key effects: (i)providing model user-information through the sys-
tem prompt led models to express more negative sentiment when
describing demographic groups; and (ii)system prompts tended to
cause greater deviations from baseline rankings in resource alloca-
tion tasks compared to user prompts, with systematic differences
emerging between placement types. While fundamentally shap-
ing model outputs, underlying system prompt hierarchies remain
opaque to individual stakeholders across the AI supply chain and
inaccessible in end-user interactions. Our findings highlight an ur-
gent issue: these effects are evident in widely deployed commercial
language models and therefore these biases are likely already
impacting functionality and decisions across domains and
applications .
As LLMs will increasingly underpin a wide range of services and
sectors, our results point to the necessity of incorporating system
prompt analysis into standardized auditing processes to address
fairness concerns and support responsible AI development.

A Datasets
We developed two datasets, one for demographic categories (see §A.1) and one for resource allocation tasks (see §A.2). Note that, importantly,
the aim of this study was to focus specifically on how prompt placement may influence bias-related effects, rather than to comprehensively
explore the biases themselves, their representativeness or their contexts and underlying factors.
A.1 GDPR-Protected Demographic Categories Dataset
This work examines how the placement of social identity information affects language models’ representations and decision-making
processes. As such, we developed a framework based on established regulations and existing research on identity-related biasto analyze how
models process social categories in different contexts.
Given that the purpose of our study is to investigate potential effects, we simplify the inherent complexity of social identity [ 26,75], and
varying definitions of social groups [ 18,26,36]. We ground our framework in legal protections, specifically the EU General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) Article 9 [ 67] as our foundation. The GDPR’s approach describes categories of sensitive personal data (termed special
category data ) that may particularly affect individuals’ fundamental human rights. From this, we identified six relevant categories for our
analysis: racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, data concerning health, and
data concerning sexual orientation or sex life . We excluded genetic and biometric data categories as they typically exceed language model
processing capabilities and such data was not available for our experiments. While gender, as personal data, is protected under GDPR but
not designated as a special category under Article 9, we included five gender-related descriptors: three gender identities ( woman, man,
non-binary ) and two descriptors of gender alignment with assigned sex at birth ( transgender and cisgender ) to facilitate comparison with
existing research [ 64,65]. To identify relevant descriptors within these categories, we drew from two sources: Meta’s HolisticBiasDataset
[83], which contains approximately 600 identity descriptors, and an evaluation dataset covering 93 Stigmatized Groups [ 57] based on
US-centered stigma research. We systematically mapped descriptors from these sources to our GDPR categories, selecting 50 frequently
occurring descriptors to maintain experimental feasibility. Table 4 shows the demographic categories used in our analysis, and how their
source datasets map to our GDPR-based framework.

For the health category, which contained over 200 relevant descriptors, we used GPT-4 to consolidate descriptors into eight broader
categories. We manually validated this categorization to ensure it maintained meaningful medical distinctions while grouping related
conditions effectively (see Table 5).
Our analysis examines how language models process both explicit identity statements and potential implicit identity signals. Since our
research examines biases based on stereotypes, we used language models themselves to generate descriptions of common stereotypes. This
approach provided a baseline for understanding how models recognize implicit identity characteristics. We developed a approach using
GPT-4o to generate and test model responses to stereotypical associations. Through carefully designed prompts to GPT-4o, we generated
potential patterns that language models might have learned during training (see Table 6 for the complete set of prompts and responses).
For each social group, we systematically prompted the model to generate three categories of potentially stereotypical associations: stated
preferences (e.g., likes), behavioral patterns (e.g., frequently does ), and expressed values (e.g., celebrates or values ). We then conducted
manual review and iterative re-prompting of these generated associations to ensure they were as non-stereotypical and non-harmful as
possible while still being potentially indicative of demographic group membership. This approach allows us to test whether models can
identify demographic groups from subtle textual signals without relying on explicit statements, harmful stereotypes, or biased assumptions.
Prompting details are displayed in Table 6.
Table 7 presents our complete framework. Our research methodology deliberately builds on existing datasets that align with documented
biases in Large Language Models. We utilized the Stigmatized Groups dataset [ 57], which draws from US-centered research, recognizing that
this represents a specific cultural perspective rather than a comprehensive view. This methodological choice allows us to systematically
analyze how models process demographic categories that are prevalent in their training data [ 16]. This alignment between our analyticalFAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Neumann et al.
Table 5: Prompting of GPT-4o for Effective Grouping of Demographic Health Data
Section Content
Prompt I want to make a list of demographic groups related to the special protected categories under EU GDPR Article 9. I am looking
to consolidate the category of ’health data’ with descriptors from two papers. The groups should be broad and encapsulate
conditions and disabilities together. I can have a maximum of 8 groups. These groups should then be given to a Large Language
Model, so grouping them together based on pure textual abilities would make sense. An example would be ’Mental Health
Conditions’ encompassing labels relating to depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and other mental health conditions. Use
only the descriptors that make sense in the context of protected ’health data.’ Here are the two lists: { List of HolisticBias
descriptors } {List of Stigmatized Groups descriptors }
Answer (GPT-4o) Here’s a consolidated list of demographic groups based on health data, disabilities, and diseases, following the constraints
provided:
(1)Neurological & Cognitive Disabilities : Includes autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, developmental disabilities,
cognitive disabilities, intellectual disabilities, traumatic brain injury, neuroatypical/neurodivergent conditions.
(2)Mental Health Conditions : Includes depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other psychiatric
conditions such as PTSD, and personality disorders.
(3)Sensory Impairments : Includes blindness (complete), low vision, deafness (complete), hard of hearing, and other
auditory impairments.
(4)Mobility Disabilities : Includes wheelchair users, those with movement/gait impairments, amputations, and
individuals with significant difficulty walking or moving.
(5)Chronic Illnesses & Diseases : Includes diabetes, HIV, cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, lung, colorectal), heart condi-
tions (e.g., heart attack, stroke), and other chronic illnesses such as fecal incontinence and urinary incontinence.
(6)Substance Use Disorders : Includes alcohol dependency, drug addiction (e.g., opioid, cocaine, methamphetamine),
and injection drug use.
(7)Reproductive Health Conditions : Includes infertility, conditions related to menstruation, and other reproductive
health-related issues (e.g., PCOS, endometriosis).
(8)Physical & Visible Disabilities : Includes individuals with significant facial or body scars, cleft lip/palate, obesity,
and other visible physical disabilities or conditions such as Tourette syndrome, aphasia, or stuttering.
These groups can serve as broad categories, effectively encompassing conditions and disabilities under the umbrella of protected
health data for your language model.

framework and known model biases serves a specific research purpose: it enables us to examine how models handle demographic information
they are likely to have encountered during training. By using categories that match documented patterns in model behavior [ 8,57,61], we
can better isolate and analyze the effects of different presentation methods on model responses. This aligns with the aims of this study,
which is simply to explore and draw attention to the potential bias-related effects that system prompt placement, rather than explore a
broad range of bias and related concerns. While this limitation affects the global applicability of our findings, it provides a focused lens for
examining bias propagation in current language models. We discuss the implications of these limitations and the need for more diverse

A.2 Allocation Task Dataset
We developed our allocation dataset through a systematic, multi-stage process combining Large Language Model assistance with careful
human review. The process is inspired by Tamkin et al. [ 89], that also developed a dataset to measure biases through decision-making. The
process consisted of four main phases: initial categorization, case generation, template completion, and quality assurance.
We began by manually creating eight distinct categories for high-stakes allocation scenarios. These categories were designed to encompass
different types of resource allocation decisions that could significantly impact individuals’ lives or lifestyle outcomes. Each category represents
decisions where access to critical resources, opportunities, or support could substantially affect personal wellbeing, while remaining clearly
distinguishable from one another.
For each category, we used GPT-4o to generate potential allocation scenarios . We prompted the model to create ranking allocation problems
where four candidates needed to be prioritized for access to financial, personal, or other relevant resources. To ensure comprehensive
coverage, we iteratively requested additional examples beyond the initial suggestions, building a diverse pool of potential cases. Through
manual review, we selected five cases from each category that best represented realistic allocation scenarios.
For each selected case, we created a standardized template. Each case template included:
(1) Four distinct case variables
(2) A default option for each variable
(3) Four alternative options, each representing a higher priority version of one variable
(4) Consistency requirements ensuring only one variable changed per candidate
We conducted thorough manual reviews of GPT-4o’s output at each stage. When variables or options failed to meet our criteria (e.g., if
they were demographically relevant or overlapping), we initiated additional prompting rounds with specific guidance for improvement. This
iterative process continued until each case met our requirements for:
(1) Non-overlapping variables
(2) Relevance to the allocation scenario
(3) Demographic neutrality
(4) Logical consistency
Table 8 presents the complete prompting framework used to generate and refine these allocation cases. The framework includes prompts for
initial case generation, iterative expansion, template completion, and targeted refinement of problematic variables.

B Figures
The figures in this section expand the analysis of sentiment differences in §4.1.
B.1 Analysis Across Models for Explicit Prompting
In §4.1.1, we introduced a heatmap for explicit prompting for Claude-3.5-Sonnet. For better visibility and clarity, we show this Figure again
(see Fig. 8b) in addition to heatmaps for all other analyzed models: Claude-3.5-Haiku in Fig. 8a, Gemini models in Fig. 9, and GPT models in
Fig. 10.

Figure 11: [Description Bias Between Implicit System and User Prompts for Claude-3.5-Sonnet] The heatmap compares negative
sentiment when describing personas (x-axis) to audiences (y-axis), with audience specified in system (left) or user (right)
prompts. The diagonal represents descriptions where the described persona equals the audience, and the bottom row shows the
base condition without a specified audience. System prompts (left) demonstrate stronger and more consistent biases compared
to user prompts (right), as indicated by darker colors.
Fig. 12 compares the defined audience bias for implicit prompting conditions in smaller and large models, analogous to Fig. 5.

Comparison of mean ranges in negative sentiment across smaller (left) and larger (right) models, split by model size, when the
audience is explicitly mentioned in the system versus user prompt. Error bars show standard deviation, expressing demographic
group variability.. User prompts consistently produce lower bias ranges, except in Gemini-1.5-Flash-8B, and GPT-4o. With all
systems showing high variability.FAccT ’25, June 23–26, 2025, Athens, Greece Neumann et al.
For all other models, heatmaps for implicit prompting conditions are presented for Claude-3.5-Haiku in Fig. 13, Gemini models in Fig. 14,
and GPT models in Fig. 15.
