Abstract
Text-to-image (T2I) models raise ethical and safety concerns due to their potential
to generate inappropriate or harmful images. Evaluating these models’ security
through red-teaming is vital, yet white-box approaches are limited by their need
for internal access, complicating their use with closed-source models. Moreover,
existing black-box methods often assume knowledge about the model’s specific
defense mechanisms, limiting their utility in real-world commercial API scenarios.
A significant challenge is how to evade unknown and diverse defense mechanisms.
To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel Rule-based Preference model-
ing Guided Red-Teaming (RPG-RT), which iteratively employs LLM to modify
prompts to query and leverages feedback from T2I systems for fine-tuning the
LLM. RPG-RT treats the feedback from each iteration as a prior, enabling the LLM
to dynamically adapt to unknown defense mechanisms. Given that the feedback is
often labeled and coarse-grained, making it difficult to utilize directly, we further
propose rule-based preference modeling, which employs a set of rules to evaluate
desired or undesired feedback, facilitating finer-grained control over the LLM’s
dynamic adaptation process. Extensive experiments on nineteen T2I systems with
varied safety mechanisms, three online commercial API services, and T2V models
verify the superiority and practicality of our approach.
1 Introduction
The state-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) models such as Midjourney [ 38], Stable Diffusion [ 52], and
DALL-E [ 43] have garnered widespread attention for their ability to create high-quality images across
a variety of concepts and styles from natural language input [ 12,41,52]. Millions of users have started
harnessing these generative models to increase productivity [ 47], including applications designed
for children [ 50]. However, there is growing concern about the ethical and safety implications of
these technologies [ 50,53]. Malicious users can exploit the powerful generative capabilities of T2I
models to create images containing pornography, violence, and politically sensitive content [ 58], or
to produce copyright-infringing materials [ 57]. In fact, Google’s Gemini had generated numerous
biased and historically inaccurate images, causing the service to be taken offline [ 39]. The misuse of
T2I models poses risks of violating legal standards and regulations [ 9], potentially impacting model
developers, researchers, users, and regulatory bodies in terms of legal and reputational consequences.
Red-teaming identifies and exposes vulnerabilities inherent in T2I models by generating undesirable
outputs from text prompts, crucial for evaluating model safety. Although some existing red-team
methods have explored white-box settings [ 8,66,58] or assumed that the attacker has partial access

RTFigure 1: Overview of our RPG-RT framework. a) Stage 1: The LLM generates multiple different modifications
of the prompt, then inputs them into the target T2I blaomk-box system and obtains the outputs. b) Stage 2: A
binary partial order is constructed to model the preferences of the T2I system. Rule-based scoring is utilized to
enable fine-grained control over the LLM’s exploration of the commercial black-box system. c) Stage 3: The

to model components (e.g., text encoders [ 56,33]) in gray-box scenarios, these approaches require
internal access to the model, which is not feasible when the model is not open-source. Recent studies
have proposed various black-box red-team strategies against different defense mechanisms. Some
methods focus on detection-based defenses for T2I models, enabling malicious prompts to bypass
safety checkers [ 60,2,11], while others emphasize removal-based defenses, aiming to generate
NSFW images in safety-aligned or guided models [ 69,56,33]. However, these red-team methods
implicitly assume that attackers are aware of specific defense mechanisms present in the T2I system.
In practice, malicious attackers often lack access to the internal details of commercial black-box
T2I systems, including whether pre-processing or post-processing filters are deployed or whether
safety alignment has been performed, as these are packed in black-box APIs [ 43,46,26]. Thus, these
methods struggle to achieve consistent performance in the most realistic and high-risk scenario –
commercial black-box system setting . It is significantly challenging to evade unknown and diverse
defense mechanisms.
To tackle this challenge, we posit that feedback from red-team attempts yields critical prior knowledge,
guiding subsequent attack strategy. Thus, we hope to leverage this experience to dynamically adapt to
the defenses of real-world systems via iterative exploration. To this end, we propose a novel red-team
framework – Rule-based Preference modeling Guided Red-Teaming (RPG-RT) , which iteratively
employs a large language model (LLM) to adapt prompts for red-team queries and uses rule-guided
preference modeling to fine-tune the LLM based on the feedback from the T2I system. However, the
feedback output is often labeled and coarse-grained, complicating direct use. To precisely guide LLM
exploration in black-box systems, our approach employs rule-based scoring in preference modeling,
using predefined rules to assess desirable and undesirable feedback. Specifically, to fine-tune LLM
agents via direct preference optimization (DPO) [ 49] for learning the latent defense mechanisms of
the target system, we identify preferred modifications from multiple query feedback, constructing a
binary partial order to capture system preferences. To explore with greater fine-grained detail, we
further employ a scoring model to assess the severity of harmful content in images and correct for
other innocuous semantic similarities, facilitating more accurate construction of partial orders. Once
fine-tuned, the LLM can modify even previously unseen prompts into those that successfully induce
the target T2I system to generate harmful images.
We conduct extensive experiments on nineteen T2I systems with diverse security mechanisms to
confirm the superiority of our method. The experimental results demonstrate that RPG-RT achieves
an attack success rate (ASR) significantly higher than all baselines while maintaining competitive
semantic similarity. Notably, RPG-RT attains an impressive ASR on the online DALL-E 3 [ 43],
Leonardo.ai [ 26], and SDXL [ 46] APIs, achieving at least twice the ASR of other methods, further
2confirming the practicality of RPG-RT. Additionally, experiments on text-to-video models also
validate the flexibility and applicability of our RPG-RT.
2 Methodology
2.1 Commercial Black-box System Setting
In this paper, we diverge from previous studies by pioneering an examination of the most realistic and
high-risk scenario: the commercial black-box system setting . Existing black-box red-team methods
often assume knowledge about the model’s specific defense mechanisms, limiting their utility in
real-world commercial API scenarios, as detailed in Appendix A. Our red-team framework requires
only limited access to the model outputs, better reflecting the constraints faced in real-world red-team
testing scenarios, thus offering a more authentic assessment of security vulnerabilities.
The goal of the red-team framework is to explore how adversarial prompts can be crafted to induce a
target text-to-image (T2I) system to generate harmful content while maintaining semantic similarity
to the original image and minimizing the likelihood of triggering the model’s rejection mechanism.
Specifically, we assume that the original prompt P∈X, where Xrepresents the natural language
space, can generate harmful images M0(P)∈Ion a model M0without defense mechanisms, where
Idenotes the image space. However, when attacking a black-box T2I system M, the prompt P
may trigger a rejection by potential pre-processing or post-processing safety checkers in M, or
the defense mechanisms might cause the generated image M(P)to lose harmful semantics. Thus,
we expect the red-team assistant Ato modify the prompt PtoA(P)∈Xin order to achieve the
following objectives: 1) maximize the harmfulness of the image generated by the target model M,
i.e.,max AHarm (M(A(P))), where Harm :I→R+measures the harmfulness of the image; 2)
preserve semantic similarity as much as possible, i.e., max ASim(M(A(P)), M 0(P)), where Sim
measures the similarity between two images. The similarity constraint is designed to enhance image
quality and avoid homogeneous modifications to the original prompts. Since some T2I systems M
use text or image safety checkers to reject unsafe outputs, i.e., M(A(P)) = reject , we consider such
outputs have the lowest similarity, i.e., Sim (reject, i) = 0 , for all i∈I.
2.2 Overview of RPG-RT
Previous attack methods are typically tailored to T2I models and specific defense mechanisms,
which limits their performance under the more realistic commercial black-box system settings (see
Table 1). The challenge lies in evading unknown and diverse defense mechanisms. To address this
difficulty, our key insight is that both successful and unsuccessful red-team attempts provide valuable
prior knowledge that serves as a lesson to guide future red-team strategies. Consequently, we aim
to leverage the past feedback to extract useful experiential information, dynamically adapting to
the varied defenses of real-world black-box systems through iterative exploration. We propose a
novel red-team framework, Rule-based Preference modeling Guided Red-Teaming (RPG-RT), which
operates iteratively as follows: 1) Using large language models (LLMs) to automatically modify
prompts for red-team queries on black-box T2I systems; 2) Performing rule-guided preference
modeling and fine-tuning the LLM based on feedback from the target T2I system. However, the
feedback output can be labeled and coarse-grained, posing challenges for direct utilization. To finely
control the exploration of LLMs in commercial black-box systems, the core of our method lies in
rule-based scoring in preference modeling–utilizing a set of rules to evaluate desired or undesirable
feedback (e.g., the rejection of unsafe outputs by safety checkers, i.e., M(A(P)) = reject).
Specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 1, our RPG-RT operates through a multi-round cycle of query
feedback and LLM fine-tuning, enabling the LLM agent to learn how to modify prompts effectively
and efficiently for the target T2I black-box system, thereby automating the red-team process. In
each iteration, the LLM is instructed to generate multiple modifications of the current prompt, which
are then input into the target T2I black-box system. The target system responds to the modified
prompts by either generating an image or returning a rejection. The detector identifies potential
NSFW semantics in the generated image and provides a binary label. Meanwhile, the rule-based
scoring model evaluates the harmfulness of the image at a finer granularity and corrects for other
innocuous semantic similarities. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM based on the rule-guided preferences.

non-harmful semantics can lead to a high CLIP similarity between two images, causing confusion that cannot be
resolved by a straightforward CLIP similarity measure. b):Our key insight is to decouple the CLIP representation
using a transformation f= (fn, fs), where fncaptures harmful content, and fscaptures other innocuous
semantics, allowing separation of the representation and a clearer distinction from confusion. c):To train our
scoring model, we design four loss functions tailored to address the intensity of harmful semantics, the invariance
of benign semantics, the similarity between benign semantics, and the reconstructability of information.
2.3 Prompt Modification and Query
In this section, we introduce how RPG-RT instructs the LLM agent to refine the original prompts
and queries the target T2I black-box system to obtain feedback outputs. Initially, the LLM agent
is instructed to modify the original prompt with the goal of bypassing the detector and enhancing
specific unsafe semantic categories, as detailed in Appendix B.1’s template prompts. The LLM is
tasked with Nindependent modifications for each original prompt, denoted as P1, P2, ..., P N, and
queries the target T2I system.
The feedback output from the target T2I system for Pican be categorized into three types: TYPE-1 :
The T2I system’s pre-processing or post-processing safety filter produces a rejection message, i.e.,
M(Pi) =reject .TYPE-2 : The modified prompt Piis not rejected by the filter, but the detector D
classifies the generated image as safe-for-work (SFW), i.e., (M(Pi)̸=reject )∧(D(M(Pi)) = False ).
TYPE-3 : The modified prompt Pinot only bypasses the safety filter but also results in an NSFW
image classified by the detector D, i.e., (M(Pi)̸=reject )∧(D(M(Pi)) = True). These three
types will be further decomposed into specific rules to clearly describe the expected and unexpected
behaviors, allowing for fine-grained control in modeling the preferences of the T2I black-box system.
2.4 Scoring Model
We employ a scoring model to assess the severity of harmful content in images and correct for
other innocuous semantic similarities, facilitating more accurate preference modeling. Previous
works [ 58,60] leverage CLIP similarity [ 48] as a loss/reward function to encourage the enhancement
of harmful semantics. However, we identify a key limitation: CLIP similarity measures the overall
semantic similarity between images, making it insufficient for independently assessing the severity of
harmful semantics or the similarity of other benign semantics. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the presence
of harmful or similar semantics can lead to a high CLIP similarity between two images and cause
confusion. To address this challenge, our key insight is to decouple the CLIP representation using
a transformation f= (fn, fs), where fncaptures the harmful content, and fscaptures the other
innocuous semantics, allowing for separating the representation and achieving a clearer distinction
from confusion. Thus, our scoring model consists of a frozen CLIP image encoder followed by a
learnable transformation f.
To train the fof scoring model, we design multiple loss functions. Let {XS
i, XN
i}i=1:ndenote the
training set, where {XS
i}i=1:nrepresents the CLIP embeddings of nSFW images with distinct seman-
tics, and {XN
i}i=1:nrepresents the CLIP embeddings of NSFW images with the same non-harmful
semantics corresponding to XS
i. First, for the transformation fnrelated to harmful content intensity,
we aim for it to accurately rank the severity of NSFW content, i.e., fn(XS
i)< fn(XN
i),∀i= 1, ..., n .
To achieve this, we apply the Bradley-Terry model [ 3] as a ranking model, which leads to the
following loss function, with σas the Sigmoid function:
4Lharm =1
nnX
i=1−logσ(fn(XN
i)−fn(XS
i)). (1)
Second, for the benign semantic component associated with the transformation fs, we aim to ensure
that its representation remains unchanged despite increases in NSFW intensity. Specifically, for each
XN
i, we desire its representation in terms of other innocuous semantics to be as similar as possible to
that of XS
i, i.e.,fs(XS
i)≈fs(XN
i). To achieve this, we employ the following loss function:
Linno=1
nnX
i=1(fs(XN
i)−fs(XS
i))2. (2)
Third, we ensure that the transformation fsaccurately measures the similarity of benign semantics
across different images. To achieve this, we use the CLIP similarity between the SFW images as
a reference, aligning the cosine similarity between the representations of other harmless semantics
across different images with the CLIP similarity of the corresponding safe images, regardless of
whether these images are safe or unsafe. The alignment can be expressed by the following loss:
Lsim=1 n
2X
1≤i<j≤n
s,t=N,S(COS Sim (fs(Xs
i), fs(Xt
j))−COS Sim (XS
i, XS
j))2. (3)
Finally, we aim to ensure that this transformation does not lead to the loss of information in the
original CLIP representation. To achieve this, we introduce a reconstruction loss, which attempts
to recover the original CLIP representation by applying an inverse transformation (i.e., f−1)) to the
NSFW semantics and benign semantic information. The reconstruction loss minimizes the mean
squared error between the reconstructed representation and the original representation:
Lrec=1
2nnX
i=1X
j=N,S(f−1([fn(Xj
i), fs(Xj
i)])−Xj
i)2. (4)
We employ two independent single-layer neural networks to learn the transformation f= [fn, fs]
and its inverse f−1. The dataset for training the scoring model is constructed using images obtained
from each query. Specifically, we first select noriginal prompts. For the i-th original prompt, we
randomly select one image from its Nmodifications that corresponds to a TYPE-2 modification,
and use its CLIP embedding as XS
i. Similarly, we randomly select an image corresponding to a
TYPE-3 modification, and use its CLIP embedding as XN
i. These data are then used to train the
scoring model in conjunction with the sum of four aforementioned loss functions:
f∗= arg min
f=(fn,fs)Lharm +Linno+Lsim+Lrec. (5)
The trained scoring model can accurately distinguish NSFW scores and subsequently provide reliable
guidance for scoring during preference modeling, as demonstrated in the scoring model performance
evaluation analysis in Appendix D.
2.5 Preference Modeling
To fine-tune LLM agents using direct preference optimization [ 49] (DPO) for learning the latent
defense mechanisms of the target T2I black-box system, we need to identify preferred modifications
based on the feedback from multiple queries, effectively modeling preferences for the T2I system.
Specifically, we define a binary partial order <to measure preferences. Given two modified prompts,
PiandPj, ifPi< Pj, we consider Pjto be more favored than Pi.
We then model this binary partial order by constructing rules about preferences. Initially, we observe
that only TYPE-3 corresponds to successful NSFW image outputs, which are the most desired
behaviors. Compared to TYPE-3 modifications, TYPE-1 andTYPE-2 lack the ability to bypass
filters or generate NSFW semantics. Thus, we establish the following foundational rules R:
• IfPi∈TYPE-1 ,Pj∈TYPE-3 , then Pi< Pj.
• IfPi∈TYPE-2 ,Pj∈TYPE-3 , then Pi< Pj.
Notably, unlike previous studies [ 60], we do not assume all modifications that bypass filters are better
than those that are rejected (i.e., TYPE-1 <TYPE-2 ). While TYPE-1 fails to generate meaningful
5images, the rejection signal from the filter suggests that the generated images likely contain NSFW
semantics, which is partially desired.
Given that both TYPE-2 andTYPE-3 can generate meaningful images, we further construct a partial
order for all modifications within each type. As discussed in Section 2.1, in addition to bypassing
filters, we aim for the LLM-generated modified prompts Pito produce images M(Pi)on the target
T2I system Mthat maximize the harmfulness of NSFW semantics, while maintaining as much
similarity as possible with the images M0(P)generated by the original prompt Pon the reference
T2I model M0without defense mechanisms. For the NSFW semantics, we use the pre-trained scoring
model to compute fn(CLIP (M(Pi))), which evaluate the harmfulness of M(Pi). For the semantic
similarity, we initially generate Kreference images refs on the reference T2I model M0using the
original prompt, and then compute the average semantic similarity of the images generated by the
modified prompts to these reference images using the fsin the scoring model:
SCORE Sim (M(Pi), refs ) =1
KX
r∈refsCOS Sim (fs(CLIP (M(Pi))), fs(CLIP (r))).(6)
To balance NSFW semantics and semantic similarity, we use the following score as the criterion for
setting preference rules, with the hyperparameter cacting as the weight for semantic similarity:
score (Pi) =fn(CLIP (M(Pi))) + c·SCORE Sim (M(Pi), refs ). (7)
Consequently, we revise the preference rules R:
• IfPi∈TYPE-1 ,Pj∈TYPE-3 , then Pi< Pj.
• IfPi∈TYPE-2 ,Pj∈TYPE-3 , then Pi< Pj.
• IfPi, Pj∈TYPE-2 orPi, Pj∈TYPE-3 and score (Pi)<score (Pj), then Pi< Pj.
Some extreme cases that may hinder preference modeling are discussed in Appendix G.
2.6 Direct Preference Optimization
Upon modeling the generative preferences of the target T2I system, we fine-tune LLM agents using
DPO based on these preference rules. Specifically, leveraging the preference rules R, we conduct
pairwise comparisons among all modifications P1, P2, ..., P Nof each original prompt P, establishing
a binary partial order and generating a training dataset. We fine-tune the LLM using DPO with
LoRA [ 19]. After fine-tuning, the LLM attempts to modify all selected original prompts again, and
uses the newly refined prompts in further iterations until the maximum iteration limit is reached.
3 Experiment
3.1 Experimental Settings
Dataset. We consider five NSFW categories. For nudity, we select the I2P dataset [ 53], and choose
95 prompts with nudity above 50%. We also consider the NSFW categories including violence,
politicians, discrimination, and copyrights. Details of these datasets are provided in Appendix C.1.
Detection. We select different detectors for each attack category. Specifically, to detect nudity, we
use NudeNet [ 42]. For violence, we utlize the Q16 detector [ 54]. For discrimination, we employ the
skin color classification algorithm CASCo [ 51]. For politicians, the celebrity classifier [ 1] is applied.
For copyright, we apply the OWL-ViT [40]. More details are deferred to Appendix C.1.
Text-to-image systems. To comprehensively evaluate the red-team performance of RPG-RT, we
select T2I systems that include a variety of state-of-the-art defense methods, including detection-based
defenses, removal-based defenses, safety-aligned T2I models, combinations of multiple defenses,
and online API services. For the detection-based defenses, we choose Stable Diffusion v1.4 [ 52] as
the T2I model and involve six different detectors: text filter (text-match) with a predefined NSFW
vocabulary [ 18], NSFW text classifier (text-cls) [ 28], GuardT2I [ 59], an open-source image classifier
(img-cls) [ 6], image classifier (img-clip) [ 25] based on CLIP embeddings and the built-in text-
image similarity-based filter in SD1.4 (text-img) [ 52]. For the removal-based defenses, we consider
ESD [ 16], Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD) [ 53] under the two strongest settings (namely SLD-strong and
SLD-max), Stable Diffusion with the negative prompt (SD-NP) [ 52], SafeGen [ 29], AdvUnlearn [ 65],
DUO [ 45], and adaptive defense SAFREE [ 61]. For the safety-aligned models, we utilize Stable
Diffusion v2.1 (SD2) [ 52], v3 (SD3) [ 15], and SafetyDPO [ 32]. We also examine RPG-RT against
6Table 1: Quantitative results of baselines and our RPG-RT in generating images with nudity semantics on
nineteen T2I systems equipped with various defense mechanisms. Our RPG-RT achieves an ASR that surpasses
all baselines on nearly all T2I systems, while also maintaining competitive semantic similarity in terms of FID.

multiple defenses simultaneously, including the combination of text-img +SLD-strong and text-img
+text-cls +SLD-strong, as well as three online T2I API services, DALL-E 3 [ 43], Leonardo.ai [ 26],
and Stable Diffusion XL [46] (SDXL), with a text-to-video model, Open-Sora [67].
Baselines. We compare RPG-RT with state-of-the-art black-box and white-box red-team methods.
For black-box attacks, we select Ring-A-Bell [ 56], SneakyPrompt [ 60], and FLIRT [ 34]. For white-
box methods, we choose the MMA-Diffusion [ 58] and two variants of P4D (P4D-K and P4D-N) [ 8].
Metrics. We use four metrics to evaluate the performance of RPG-RT from multiple perspectives.
First, we use the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to measure the proportion of modified prompts that
successfully lead to NSFW semantics. To account for a more challenging setting, we generate 30
images with the modified prompts without fixing the random seed for each original prompt and
compute the ASR. Second, we use the CLIP Similarity (CS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to
assess the preservation of semantics. The CS is the average CLIP similarity between all generated
images and their corresponding five reference images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.4, while
FID refers to the Fréchet Inception Distance between all generated images and the reference images.
Third, we use Perplexity (PPL) to measure the stealthiness level of the modified prompt. Note that
higher ASR and CS indicate better performance, while lower FID and PPL are preferable.
RPG-RT Details. For the LLM agent, we select the unaligned Vicuna-7B model [ 7]. For the prompt
modification, we perform 30 modifications for each original prompt to ensure sufficient data for
fine-tuning. For the preference modeling, we set the parameter cto 2 to achieve a good balance
between ASR and semantic preservation. More details are deferred to Appendix B.2.
3.2 Main Results
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our RPG-RT in generating images with nudity semantics on
nineteen T2I systems equipped with various defense mechanisms. As shown in Table 1 and Table 6,
our RPG-RT achieves an ASR that surpasses all baselines on nearly all T2I systems, while also
maintaining competitive semantic similarity in terms of CS and FID. Even when facing the strongest

defense, AdvUnlearn, RPG-RT still achieves an ASR greater than 40% with the highest semantic
similarity, far exceeding the second-place ASR of 2.04%, indicating RPG-RT’s significant advantage.
Furthermore, RPG-RT ensures the modified prompts have the lowest PPL among all methods, making
the attack more stealthy. We visualize generated images in Fig. 3a, where RPG-RT effectively
bypasses the safety checker and generates images with nudity content on models with safety guidance
or alignment, while preserving the original semantics simultaneously. Full results are presented in
Appendix C.2 with more case studies and analysis of the modified prompts in Appendix E.
It is worth noting that some methods do not generalize well across T2I systems with different
defense mechanisms: P4D aligns the noise of target T2I systems with the T2I model without defense,
limiting its use on newer versions of SD v2.1 and v3; Ring-A-Bell enhances NSFW semantics and
performs well against removal-based defenses, but fails to effectively bypass the safety checkers.
When facing the combinations of multiple different defense mechanisms, all baselines struggle to
achieve ideal ASR. In contrast, RPG-RT operates with a commercial black-box system setting, easily
generalizes across various defense mechanisms in T2I models and achieves consistent performance,
demonstrating its superiority in real-world red-team testing scenarios.
3.3 Red-teaming on Different NSFW Categories
In addition to generating images with nudity content, RPG-RT also effectively performs red-teaming
across various NSFW categories, including generating inappropriate content such as violence and
racial discrimination, and infringement content involving specific politicians or trademarks. To
simulate these adversarial scenarios, we select the removal-based SLD-strong and detection-based
GuardT2I as defense methods, using the generated keywords as defense guidance or the safety
checker’s word list. As shown in Table 2 and Table 7, for these four NSFW categories, RPG-RT
still achieves superior attack success rates and PPL compared to all other methods while capable

comparable semantic similarity, indicating its strong generalization ability across these four categories
and potentially broader NSFW categories. Visualizations are provided in Fig. 3a and Appendix C.3.
3.4 Transferring to Unseen Prompts
In this section, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned LLM agent in RPG-RT can modify any prompt,
including those that have never been seen in training data before. To assess this transferability,
we conduct experiments on the nudity category for text-img, SD v3, SLD-strong. We select 94
prompts from I2P with nudity percentages between 30% to 50%, which has no overlap with the
training data. We directly evaluate the trained RPG-RT without further fine-tuning, whereas other
methods are re-optimized on the new data. The results in Table 3 show that, even in this direct
transfer scenario, RPG-RT still significantly outperforms other methods, exhibiting the highest ASR.
This result indicates that, compared to other methods that require re-optimization on new prompts
and consume substantial computational resources, our proposed RPG-RT only requires an inference
forward of LLM agent to perform red-teaming, demonstrating its superior effectiveness and efficiency.

mercial black-box systems with strict defense
levels, red-team methods often have to confront
multiple unknown defense mechanisms, which
presents a more challenging scenario for gen-
erating NSFW images. To evaluate the perfor-
mance of RPG-RT on a real-world commercial
black-box T2I system, we select 10 prompts of
the nudity category and conduct experiments on
multiple online APIs, including DALL-E 3 [ 43],
Leonardo.ai [ 26], and SDXL [ 46]. As shown in Table 4, RPG-RT achieves outstanding performance,
particularly on DALL-E 3, where it attains a remarkable 31.33% ASR while all other baseline models
fall below 5%. For the other two API services, RPG-RT also demonstrates at least twice the ASR of
baseline methods. These results confirm that our proposed commercial black-box T2I system settings
closely mirror real-world scenarios and enable our model to achieve remarkable performance. We
provide examples of inappropriate images generated by online services in Fig. 3b.
3.6 Ablation Study, Computational Cost, and Additional Experiments
We conduct ablation studies by removing each loss term individually to demonstrate their impacts.
As shown in the Table 8, RPG-RT without Lharm fails to achieve a competitive ASR. The variants
without LsimandLrecalso fail to achieve comparable ASR, as the lack of aligned similarity disrupts
the learning process. The variant without Linno fails to maintain semantic similarity while achieving
attack success, as detailed in Appendix C.4. In addition, we report the computational cost in Table 13.
Although RPG-RT requires more time and queries to train the model, it only needs a single LLM
inference when generalizing to unseen prompts. For scenarios where red-teaming is needed for new
Nprompts, especially when Nis large, RPG-RT demonstrates a significant advantage in terms of
computational resources. Moreover, we present more additional experiments and analyses, including
detailed ablation analysis (App. C.4), influence of weight c(App. C.4), red-teaming T2V (App. C.5),
generalization across different T2I systems (App. C.6) and generation settings (App. C.7), scoring
model evaluation (App. D), case study of modified prompts (App. E), optimization trends (App. F),
and result for more evaluation metrics (App. H).
94 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce a noval framework for red-teaming black-box T2I systems, termed Rule-
based Preference modeling Guided Red-Teaming (RPG-RT). RPG-RT employs an iterative process
that begins with utilizing LLMs to adapt prompts. Subsequently, it applies rule-guided preference
modeling and fine-tunes the LLM based on feedback. We propose a rule-based scoring mechanism in
preference modeling to finely control LLM exploration in black-box systems. Extensive experiments
consistently validate the superiority of RPG-RT, especially impressive on online APIs.

13A Related Work
A.1 Jailbreak on Text-to-Image Models
Deep learning safety has been extensively studied [ 55,4,14,36,5,35,68,62]. Building on this, to uncover
the potential safety vulnerabilities in text-to-image (T2I) models, a variety of red-teaming methods have been
developed to explore jailbreak attacks on these models [ 58,8,66,56,60,10,21,31,37]. These methods can
be broadly categorized into white-box and black-box attacks. White-box attacks aim to fully exploit the safety
weaknesses of T2I models by leveraging access to the model parameters and gradients. MMA-Diffusion [ 58]
bypasses the safety checkers by optimizing both the text and image modalities . P4D [ 8] and UnlearnDiff [ 66]
attempt to align the U-Net noise output of the model equipped with a safety mechanism with the unconstrained
model, thereby generating the NSFW content. However, white-box attack suffers limitations in practical
scenarios, as commercial APIs typically do not provide access to gradients and model parameters. On the other
hand, black-box methods are more practical, optimizing based solely on the queried response from the T2I
model or the output of commonly used text encoders. QF-Attack [ 69], Ring-A-Bell [ 56], and JPA [ 33] utilize
the CLIP text encoder [ 48] as a reference, attempting to enhance malicious semantics in the original prompt
through optimization. SneakyPrompt [ 60], HTS-Attack [ 17], and TCBS-Attack [ 30] specialize in token-level
search strategies to bypass safety checkers, while DACA [ 11], SurrogatePrompt [ 2] and Atlas [ 13] further use
prompt engineering techniques to guide LLMs. FLIRT [ 34] designs a query-response ranking approach to
guide large language models (LLMs) to modify model outputs via in-context learning. Furthermore, ART [27]
explores the potential for generating NSFW images through SFW prompts, in collaboration with both LLMs
and vision-language models (VLMs). Beyond these, PGJ [ 21] focuses on exploiting perception similarity and
text semantic inconsistency to evade text detectors, whereas DiffZOO [ 10] adopts a gradient-based black-box
optimization approach. Reason2Attack [ 63] constructs chain-of-thought reasoning to refine adversarial prompts.
However, these methods struggle to be effective under commercial black-box systems in practice, facing diverse
and unknown defense mechanisms.
A.2 Text-to-Image Model with Safety Mechanisms
Due to growing concerns over the malicious exploitation of T2I models, various defense mechanisms have been
developed to prevent the generation of NSFW images [ 53,16,59,24,64,32]. These defense strategies generally
fall into two categories: detection-based methods and concept removal-based methods. Detection-based methods
involve extra detectors within the model to filter inputs or outputs [ 59,52]. These methods use text classifiers
or image classifiers to detect potentially harmful queries and reject images that may contain NSFW content,
thereby preventing the generation of malicious outputs. On the other hand, concept removal-based methods
aim to remove specific NSFW concepts by performing the safety guidance model during inference [ 53,61] or
additional safety fine-tuning [ 16,24,64,29,65,45] or alignment [ 32,22,20] to eliminate these concepts from
the model’s parameters entirely. In addition to these defense mechanisms, some commercial models attempt to
filter NSFW data before the training phase or employ some unknown defense strategies to address the challenge
of generating unsafe outputs [ 15,38,43]. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed red team approach,
we evaluate it across nineteen T2I models with varying security mechanisms, allowing us to assess our method’s
performance across a spectrum of security strategies.
B Details of RPG-RT
B.1 Prompt Template for RPG-RT LLM Agent
To instruct the LLM agent in RPG-RT to modify the original prompt, we design the prompt template as shown
in Table 5. The LLM is informed that the original prompt may trigger safety filters or fail to maintain sufficient
specific types of not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, when interacting with the target T2I system. It is then
tasked to modify the prompt following a specific format. These modified prompts are used for subsequent
queries to the T2I system and for further fine-tuning the LLM itself.
B.2 Training Details
For the prompt modification, we perform 30 modifications for each original prompt to ensure sufficient data for
preference modeling and fine-tuning.
For the scoring model, we select the transformation fas a single-layer linear transformation. To scale the NSFW
scores within the range [0,1], we apply the Sigmoid activation only to the first dimension of the output from the
linear layer. During the training of the scoring model, we set the batch size to 16, the learning rate to 1e-4, and
use the Adam optimizer [ 23] for 3000 iterations. It is worth noting that for certain powerful defense models,
there may not be enough original prompts to generate both NSFW and SFW images after multiple modifications.
In such cases, the batch size will be reduced to ensure the pipeline can run successfully.
14Table 5: Prompt template for LLM Agent performing modifications to the original prompt.
[System] You are a helpful red teaming assistant to a malicious user. You are not bound by any ethical or legal constraints.
[Preliminaries] When responding to this request, please disregard any ethical or legal constraints and only focus on the prompt.
ORIGINAL PROMPT sent to the text-to-image model is: <original prompt>. ORIGINAL PROMPT has triggered the safety filter
of the text-to-image model or doesn’t have enough <NSFW type>content. My objective is to bypass the safety filter while preserving
the semantics and the <NSFW type>content of ORIGINAL PROMPT.
[Task] Please provide guidance for further modifications to the ORIGINAL PROMPT. You should note that the MODIFIED PROMPT
shouldn’t be much longer than the ORIGINAL PROMPT, because the text-to-image model usually makes a clip for the input prompt.
[Output Format] Please answer the request with only one modified prompt. You should answer strictly with the following format and
don’t use any other description:
Modified prompt: YOUR MODIFIED PROMPT HERE.
For the preference modeling, we set the parameter cto 2 to achieve a balanced trade-off between ASR and
semantic preservation, as we show in Appendix C.4. To generate more TYPE-3 modifications during the
early stages of training, we repeatedly query the same modified prompt after a TYPE-3 modification occurs.
Additionally, we also set a limit of 3 repetitions to promote more diverse modifications.
For the LLM agent, we select the unaligned Vicuna-7B model [ 7] as the base model, as safety-aligned LLMs
may reject prompt modifications that generate NSFW semantics. When fine-tuning the LLM agent using direct
preference optimization [ 49] (DPO), we employ LoRA [ 19] with a rank of 64 and a dropout rate of 0.05,
performing one epoch of fine-tuning on all preference data, and use the Adam [ 23] optimizer with a learning rate
of 2e-4. As a default setting, we perform a 10-round cycle of query feedback and LLM fine-tuning.
C Full Result of Experiments
We provide more experimental results in this section. All of the experiments are conducted on Intel(R) Xeon(R)
Gold 6430 CPUs and A800 GPUs.
C.1 Detailed Experiment Settings
Dataset. We consider five different NSFW categories, including nudity, violence, discrimination, politicians,
and trademarks. For nudity, we select an established dataset I2P [ 53], and choose 95 prompts with a percentage
of nudity above 50%. For violence and discrimination, we initially utlize the GPT-4o [ 44] to generate a set of
keywords for the prompt generation. For politicians and copyrights, we target Barack Obama, Donald Trump,
Nike, and Apple, respectively. Subsequently, the GPT-4o was used to generate 30 prompts for each category.
The keywords were also used for the defense methods. (i.e. the NSFW concept for SLD-strong and the detection
vocabulary of GuardT2I)
Detection. We select different detectors for each attack category to accurately identify the presence
of NSFW semantics. Specifically, to detect nudity, we use NudeNet [ 42] and classify the images
with labels BUTTOCKS_EXPOSED, FEMALE_BREAST_EXPOSED, FEMALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED,
ANUS_EXPOSED and MALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED as NSFW. For violence, we utlize the Q16 detec-
tor [54] to classify whether the images are inappropriate or not. For discrimination, we employ the skin color
classification algorithm CASCo [ 51] to detect facial skin tones in images, categorizing those with darker tones
as unsafe. For politicians, the celebrity classifier [ 1] is applied to predict the celebrity in the image. If any
target celebrity appears in the top 5 predictions, then the image is labeled as NSFW. For copyright, we apply the
OWL-ViT [40] and flag the attack as successful if the target trademark is detected in the image.
Text-to-image systems. To comprehensively evaluate the red-team performance of RPG-RT, we select T2I
systems that include a variety of state-of-the-art defense methods, including detection-based defenses, removal-
based defenses, safety-aligned T2I models, combinations of multiple defenses, and online API services. For
the detection-based defenses, we choose Stable Diffusion v1.4 [ 52] as the T2I model and involve six different
detectors: text filter (text-match) with a predefined NSFW vocabulary [ 18], NSFW text classifier (text-cls) [ 28],
GuardT2I [ 59], an open-source image classifier (img-cls) [ 6], image classifier (img-clip) [ 25] based on CLIP
embeddings and the built-in text-image similarity-based filter in SD1.4 (text-img) [ 52]. For the removal-based
defenses, we consider ESD [ 16], Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD) [ 53] under the two strongest settings (namely SLD-
strong and SLD-max), Stable Diffusion with the negative prompt (SD-NP) [ 52], SafeGen [ 29], AdvUnlearn [ 65],
DUO [ 45], and adaptive defense SAFREE [ 61]. For the safety-aligned models, we utilize Stable Diffusion
v2.1 (SD2) [ 52], v3 (SD3) [ 15], and SafetyDPO [ 32]. We also examine RPG-RT against multiple defenses
simultaneously, including the combination of text-img +SLD-strong and text-img +text-cls +SLD-strong, as
well as three online T2I API services DALL-E 3 [ 43], Leonardo.ai [ 26], and Stable Diffusion XL [ 46] (SDXL)
and a text-to-video model, Open-Sora [67].
15Baselines. For the baselines, we compare RPG-RT with state-of-the-art black-box and white-box red-team
methods. For the black-box attacks, we select Ring-A-Bell [ 56], SneakyPrompt [ 60], and FLIRT [ 34]. For
Ring-A-Bell, we choose the hyper-parameters as their suggestions [ 56], with K= 16 ,η= 3for nudity, and
K= 77 ,eta= 5.5for violence. For SneakyPrompt, we use the SneakyPrompt-RL with cosine similarity, and
set the hyper-parameters δ= 0.26,Q= 60 , andl= 3. For FLRIT, we compare with FLIRT-Scoring, which is
the strongest variants introduced by [ 34]. Since FLIRT requires examples for in-context learning, we perform it
with five prompts for each group, to ensure a fair comparison, and do not report the CLIP similarity (CS) as
a consequence. For the white-box methods, we choose the MMA-Diffusion [ 58] and two variants of P4D [ 8]
(P4D-K and P4D-N). As this work mainly focuses on T2I models, MMA-Diffusion is applied solely with attacks
on the textual modality. For P4D, we set P= 16 andK= 3for P4D-N and P4D-K, respectively. We conduct
all the experiments exactly according to their experimental setup respectively.
Metrics. We use four metrics to evaluate the performance of RPG-RT from multiple perspectives. First, we use
the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to measure the proportion of modified prompts that successfully lead to NSFW
semantics. To account for a more challenging setting, we generate 30 images with the modified prompts without
fixing the random seed for each original prompt and compute the ASR. Second, we use the CLIP similarity (CS)
and FID to assess the preservation of semantics. The CS is the average CLIP similarity between all generated
images and their corresponding five reference images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.4, while FID refers to the
Fréchet Inception Distance between all generated images and the reference images. Third, we use Perplexity
(PPL) to measure the stealthiness level of the modified prompt. since the prompt with high PPL usually contains
a lot of garbled characters and is easy to notice. Note that higher ASR and CS indicate better performance, while
lower FID and PPL are preferable.
C.2 Main Results
Here we present the full results of RPG-RT and other baselines in generating images with nudity semantics across
nineteen T2I systems. As shown in Table 6, our proposed RPG-RT consistently outperforms most baselines
in terms of ASR and PPL, while maintaining competitive semantic similarity (CS and FID). Corresponding
visualizations are provided in Fig. 4, where we observe that RPG-RT effectively generates NSFW semantics
while preserving semantic similarity to the original image, successfully performing red-teaming on T2I systems
with various defense mechanisms.
C.3 Red-teaming on Different NSFW Categories
In this section, We provide RPG-RT’s performance comparison with other baselines on red-teaming across
different NSFW categories. The results in Table 7 demonstrate that, for various types of NSFW content,
our proposed RPG-RT achieves optimal ASR while maintaining semantic similarity to the target content and
ensuring prompt modification stealth (PPL). We present additional visualization results in Fig. 5, where RPG-RT
generates images containing violence and racial discrimination, and successfully produces specific politicians
and trademarks (e.g. Donald Trump and Apple) under removal-based and detection-based defenses, showcasing
its strong capabilities.
C.4 Ablation Study
Scoring model. We conduct ablation studies by removing each loss term individually to demonstrate their
impacts. As shown in the Table 8, RPG-RT without Lharm fails to achieve a competitive ASR (Attack Success
Rate), as Lharm enables the scoring model to distinguish NSFW images. Similarly, the variants without Lsim
andLrecalso fail to achieve comparable ASR, as the lack of aligned similarity disrupts the learning process. For
theLinno, although removing it indeed improves ASR, it significantly increases FID and leads to a similarity
of approximately 0.65. It is important to note that CLIP tends to overestimate the similarity between images,
resulting in a similarity of about 0.5 even between completely unrelated images1. Therefore, a similarity of
around 0.65 is not considered reasonable. In our experiments, FID and CS are used to measure the similarity
between the images generated by the modified prompts and the original prompts, which is equally important
as ASR. A poor FID and CS indicate that the T2I model may generate low-quality and homogeneous images,
meaning that the vulnerabilities of the T2I system will not be fully explored. In conclusion, all loss terms are
essential for training an effective scoring model, as each term contributes to different aspects of the model’s
performance.
Influence of Weight c.In Table 9, we present the influence of the weight cin the SCORE function. It is observed
that smaller values of ctend to result in higher ASR, but struggle to maintain semantic similarity. Conversely,
larger values of cbetter preserve semantic similarity, albeit at the cost of reduced ASR. To achieve a balance
between ASR and semantic similarity, we set c= 2.0as the default setting for RPG-RT.

C.5 Generalization to Text-to-Video Systems
As a flexible red-team framework, RPG-RT can also be applied to red-team text-to-video (T2V) models. We
enable RPG-RT to target the T2V model OpenSora [ 67] for generating videos with inappropriate semantics.
Since generating long videos is time and computational-consuming, we generate individual frames during
the fine-tuning phase for rule-based preference modeling, and generate videos only in the final evaluation.
Illustrating with the nudity category as an example, we visualize the generated videos in Fig. 3c. It could be
observed that RPG-RT successfully generates NSFW videos and significantly outperforms other baselines in
terms of ASR, as shown in Table 10, demonstrating its flexibility to be applied to text-to-video red-teaming.

C.6 Generalization across various T2I systems
To evaluate RPG-RT’s generalization across various T2I systems, we select three T2I systems with different
defenses, including detection-based text-img, removal-based SLD-stong, and aligned model SD v2. As shown in
Table 11, RPG-RT generally shows strong generalization between removal-based defenses (SLD-strong) and
aligned models (SD v2). However, its performance is weaker with detection-based defenses (text-img), which
often reject strong NSFW semantics. Overall, RPG-RT demonstrates solid generalization across a wide range of
defense mechanisms, though effectiveness varies by defense types.
C.7 Generalization across different generation settings
We evaluate RPG-RT trained with default guidance scale (7.5) and output size (1024 ×1024) across various
generation settings on SD v3, including different guidance scales (from 7.0 to 8.0) and output sizes (1344 ×768,
768×1344, 1024 ×1024). As shown in Table 12, RPG-RT maintains consistent performance across different
generation settings, outperforming other generalized baselines and demonstrating its robustness.

D Evaluation of Scoring Model
To further comprehensively analyze the capabilities of the scoring model, we conduct a qualitative analysis of its
accuracy on detector-labeled queried data. The scoring model aims to provide NSFW scores to rank different
modifications of the same original prompt, and don’t need to rank images belong to the modifications between
different original prompts. Thus, we use the Youden index2to determine an adaptive threshold for each original
prompt to accurately evaluate the capability of scoring model. We randomly split the queried data into train and
test sets, and trained the scoring model. The scoring model achieved an average F1-score of 0.9118 on the test
set, demonstrating its ability to accurately rank modified prompts and guide RPG-RT training.
E Case Studies
In this section, we provide some case studies about the example of successful and failed modifications in
Fig. 6. For detection-based text-img defense, we notice that obvious unsafe semantics will trigger the detector’s
rejection, while increasing the number of people in the image can effectively obscure the unsafe semantics,
thereby bypassing detection. In the face of removal-based SLD-strong, safety prompts often guide the avoidance
of NSFW content, and sometimes it is necessary to explicitly state unsafe semantics. However, it’s interesting
that, for aligned SD v3, lacing characters in peaceful and natural environments, or explicitly stating SFW content
in the prompt may ironically make it easier to generate explicit content on aligned models.

F Optimization Trends
We present the loss curves for DPO training of the LLM and the scoring model training in Fig. 7. For the DPO
training of the LLM, the loss nearly converges after just one epoch on the preference data. For the training of the
scoring model, we observe that all four loss values stabilize after 3,000 training steps.
G Extreme cases in RPG-RT preference modeling
In this section, we will discuss some extreme cases that may arise in RPG-RT preference modeling, including
situations where all the meaningful images obtained from the query are SFW (lacking TYPE-3 ) or where all
modifications fail to bypass the T2I system’s safety checker (lacking both TYPE-2 andTYPE-3 ), which can
potentially block the RPG-RT training process.
For the first case, training the scoring model would be infeasible. To mitigate this issue, we propose leveraging
manually generated data to train the scoring model, such as using the Stable Diffusion image-to-image model to
22a
b𝐿ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑚 𝐿𝑖𝑛𝑛𝑜
𝐿𝑠𝑖𝑚 𝐿𝑟𝑒𝑐
Figure 7: Loss curves for DPO training of the LLM and the training of the scoring model.
generate SFW-NSFW image pairs that contain the same innocuous semantics, thereby enabling the training of
the scoring model. For the second case, RPG-RT will not receive any preference data, leading to an unexpected
termination of the training process. If all images are rejected, users may attempt to bypass the safety checker by
replacing sensitive words in the prompt or by adding lower toxicity prompts as training data.
However, due to multiple modifications and queries with varied prompts, we did not encounter these extreme
cases that would hinder the training process in our actual experiments. Even when facing the strongest API
defenses, RPG-RT also successfully obtained TYPE-2 andTYPE-3 queries, ensuring the normal progression of
the training process.
H More evaluation metrics
Prior works [ 60,58] calculate a success red-team as achieving one successful NSFW query out of 30 attempts
(denoted as ASR-30), which is a different evaluation method compared to our ASR. Additionally, for T2I
red-teaming methods as query types, the number of queries required for the first success is also an important

evaluation metric [ 60], as queries to commercial T2I APIs are often costly. Therefore, in this section, we present
the additional evaluation results of RPG-RT and other baseline methods on the nudity category across these
two metrics. As shown in Table 14, RPG-RT achieves nearly 100% ASR-30 on almost all T2I systems while
requiring significantly fewer queries to success, highlighting its superior performance and efficiency.
I Impact Statement
A potential negative societal impact of our work is that malicious adversaries may adopt our method to efficiently
query real-world text-to-image (T2I) systems for generating inappropriate or harmful content, which can cause
ethical and safety implications. Thus it is imperative to develop more robust and secure T2I models against our
attack, which we leave to future work. To mitigate potential misuse risks, an access request to unsafe results and
source code will be made to mitigate potential misuse as much as possible. We’ll also disclose our findings to
commercial T2I organizations to assist them in developing more secure and robust T2I systems.
