Abstract
I present a categorical framework for analyzing fixed-point emergence
in educational feedback systems, where exam-grade collapse mechanisms
prevent the formation of stable learner identities. Using endofunctors and
initial algebras from category theory, I model learning processes as gen-
erative functors φthat would naturally converge to fixed-point identities
under transfinite iteration. However, when educational assessment intro-
duces entropy-reducing collapse functors E, I prove that no nontrivial
initial algebra can exist for the composite functor F=E◦φ. This math-
ematical obstruction categorically blocks creativity-driven identity emer-
gence, creating what I term ”fixed-point traps” in educational systems.
My results demonstrate that exam-driven feedback loops fundamentally
prevent the stabilization of learner identities, offering a formal explanation
for creativity suppression in assessment-heavy educational environments.

11 Preliminaries and Notation
Definition 1.1 (Category and Identity Morphisms) .A category Cconsists of a
class of objects Ob(C), a class of morphisms (arrows) Hom(C), source and target
maps assigning to each morphism fits domain and codomain, a composition
law, and for each object Xan identity morphism idXsatisfying idX◦f=fand
g◦idX=gwhenever composable. These data satisfy associativity of composition
(see [2]).
Definition 1.2 (Endofunctor and φ-Algebra) .LetCbe a category. An endo-
functor φ:C → C assigns to each object Xan object φ(X)and to each morphism
f:X→Ya morphism φ(f) :φ(X)→φ(Y), preserving identities and compo-
sition. A φ-algebra is a pair (X, α)where X∈Ob(C)andα:φ(X)→Xis a
morphism in C. A morphism of φ-algebras (X, α)→(Y, β)is a map h:X→Y
withh◦α=β◦φ(h). An initial φ-algebra is a φ-algebra (µφ, ι)such that for
every (X, α)there is a unique φ-algebra homomorphism (µφ, ι)→(X, α).
Definition 1.3 (Fixed-Point Object as Identity) .The transfinite φ-chain start-
ing from an initial object 0(assumed in C) is defined by X0= 0,Xn+1=φ(Xn),
and for limit ordinals λ,Xλ= colim γ<λXγ. If this chain converges at stage
Λso that XΛ∼=φ(XΛ), the object XΛis called the fixed-point object or initial
fixed point of φ. We denote this object by µφ. By definition µφ∼=φ(µφ), so
µφis a (least) fixed point of φand is regarded as the categorical identity of the
generative process φ.
Lemma 1.1 (Lambek’s Lemma) .If(µφ, ι)is an initial φ-algebra, then the
structure map ι:φ(µφ)→µφis an isomorphism. In particular, µφis a fixed
point of φ(up to isomorphism). Equivalently, any initial φ-algebra is in fact a
fixed-point algebra [2].
22 Exam-Grade Collapse Systems
Definition 2.1 (Fold/Collapse Morphism) .LetCbe as above, endowed with
a complexity measure h: Ob(C)→Ord (an ”entropy”). A morphism f:
X→YinCis called a fold or entropy-reducing collapse if fis an epimorphism
(surjective on structure) that is not invertible, and h(Y)< h(X)(sofidentifies
distinct substructures of XinY). For example, in the observer-coupled collapse
of [4], the perturbed identity contains two copies of the core identity and thus is
collapsed back to the original; such a canonicalization is a fold.
Definition 2.2 (Exam-Grade Collapse System) .An Exam-Grade Collapse Sys-
tem (EGCS) consists of a category C(with an initial object) together with:
•a generative endofunctor φ:C → C (modeling creative learning/update),
and
•a collapse endofunctor E:C → C (modeling the exam+grading process),
plus a natural transformation ε:φ⇒E◦φwhose component εX:φ(X)→
E(φ(X))is a fold for every object X.
Thus each examination step applies φand then collapses via E, strictly reducing
entropy. We require h(E(φ(X)))< h(φ(X))for all X, so the exam functor E
always maps states into strictly ”lower-entropy” subspaces.
Proposition 2.1 (Entropy Reduction) .In an EGCS, for every object Xthe
composite morphism
φ(X)εX− − →E(φ(X))
is a fold and hence h(E(φ(X)))< h(φ(X)). In particular each exam collapses
the state space.
Proof. By Definition 2.2, εXis an epi that is not invertible, so by definition a
fold. By assumption h(E(φ(X)))< h(φ(X)).□
33 Fixed-Point Trap in EGCS
Theorem 3.1 (Nonexistence of Nontrivial Fixed-Point) .In an EGCS, the com-
posite functor F=E◦φadmits no nontrivial initial algebra. Equivalently, there
is no object X̸∼=0satisfying X∼=F(X)(fixed point) except the trivial initial
object.
Proof. Suppose for contradiction that ( µ, ι) is an initial F-algebra, i.e. ι:F(µ) =
E(φ(µ))→µis initial. By Lambek’s lemma, ιis an isomorphism and µ∼=
F(µ) =E(φ(µ)). But since εµ:φ(µ)→E(φ(µ)) is a fold, E(φ(µ)) has strictly
lower entropy than φ(µ). Thus φ(µ)̸∼=E(φ(µ)) unless µis degenerate (initial).
In particular, E(φ(µ)) cannot be isomorphic to µunless µ∼=0. Hence the
assumed isomorphism µ∼=E(φ(µ)) fails. This contradiction shows no nontrivial
initial F-algebra can exist. □
Corollary 3.1 (Identity Emergence Blocked) .Because no initial F-algebra ex-
ists in the EGCS, there is no emergent ”identity object” µFthat is fixed by F. In
particular, the process φcannot produce its own identity via transfinite iteration
once the exam collapse is enforced. Equivalently, there is no universal fixed-
point object in Cunder F, so the category of F-algebras has no terminal/initial
object to play the role of a stabilized identity.
Proof. Immediate from Theorem 3.1 and the definition of identity-as-fixed-
point. Indeed, in ordinary [3] the identity of φis given by the initial φ-algebra
(the colimit of the chain), whose existence is now precluded. Without µF, there
is no canonical identity morphism in the emergent algebra of states; in fact, in
[3] it was shown that the unique homomorphism ! : µφ→X(for any φ-algebra
(X, α)) realizes the ”generative identity” on X. Since µFdoes not exist, that
identity map cannot be defined. □
44φ-Emergence and Creativity Blockage
Definition 4.1 (φ-Emergence of Identity) .We say the endofunctor φexhibits
φ-emergence of identity if the transfinite iteration of φconverges to an initial
algebra µφwhich serves as its identity (as in [3]). In the absence of collapse,
µφis the unique object with φ(µφ)∼=µφ.
Theorem 4.1 (Categorical Blocking of Creativity) .In an EGCS, any φ-emergence
of identity is categorically blocked. That is, even for a ”creativity-driven” func-
torφ, the required fixed-point object µφcannot form because the exam-induced
collapse intervenes. Hence creativity-driven emergence of φ’s identity is impos-
sible.
Proof. By [3], the essence of identity emergence is that under transfinite itera-
tion of φ, a unique fixed point µφappears as the initial φ-algebra. But in the
EGCS the actual process is controlled by F=E◦φ. Theorem 3.1 showed that
Fhas no nontrivial initial algebra, so φcannot reach its would-be fixed point.
Concretely, each step φ(X) is immediately collapsed by Einto a lower-entropy
state. By analogy to [4], an ”observer-coupled collapse” repeatedly injects re-
dundant structure (copying the identity into itself); here exams play the role of
the observer, permanently perturbing and collapsing the learner’s state. Thus
any candidate identity φ-algebra never stabilizes. In summary, the universal
invariant fixed point of φ(the creative identity) is prevented from emerging by
the entropy-reducing folds. □
Remark. My construction and proofs use only standard categorical notions
(categories, functors, initial algebras) in the Bourbaki–Mac Lane tradition [1, 2].
The key observation is that exam+grading constitute a functorial collapse that
violates the usual convergence conditions for initial algebras. This furnishes a
purely mathematical fixed-point trap: the system has universal colimits and
initial objects, yet every generative chain is pulled into a low-entropy state that
lacks a new identity. Consequently, creativity-driven φ-emergence is categori-
cally obstructed.
55 Conclusion
We have established a categorical framework demonstrating that exam-grade
collapse systems fundamentally obstruct the formation of stable learner identi-
ties. The mathematical core lies in proving that composite functors F=E◦φ
cannot admit nontrivial initial algebras when the exam functor Eenforces
entropy-reducing collapses.
This result provides a formal foundation for understanding creativity suppres-
sion in assessment-heavy educational environments. The fixed-point trap mech-
anism shows that repeated examination processes prevent the natural conver-
gence of learning dynamics to stable identity states, suggesting that alternative
assessment approaches may be necessary to support creative development.
Future work will extend this framework to analyze specific educational inter-
ventions and explore categorical conditions under which identity emergence can
be preserved despite evaluative pressures.
