Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in clinical
question answering, with recent multi-agent frameworks further improving diag-
nostic accuracy via collaborative reasoning. However, we identify a recurring issue
ofSilent Agreement , where agents prematurely converge on diagnoses without
sufficient critical analysis, particularly in complex or ambiguous cases. We present
a new concept called Catfish Agent , a role-specialized LLM designed to inject
structured dissent and counter silent agreement. Inspired by the “catfish effect” in
organizational psychology, the Catfish Agent is designed to challenge emerging
consensus to stimulate deeper reasoning. We formulate two mechanisms to encour-
age effective and context-aware interventions: (i) a complexity-aware intervention
that modulates agent engagement based on case difficulty, and (ii) a tone-calibrated
intervention articulated to balance critique and collaboration. Evaluations on nine
medical Q&A and three medical VQA benchmarks show that our approach con-
sistently outperforms both single- and multi-agent LLMs frameworks, including
leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.
1 Introduction
“Without contraries is no progression. ” — W ILLIAM BLAKE
Progress often emerges not from agreement but from conflict, when ideas clash and debate arises,
before a better solution is derived. This insight resonates deeply in collaborative reasoning.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical diagnosis by leverag-
ing extensive clinical knowledge [ 38]. To enhance diagnostic robustness, recent work has proposed
LLM-based multi-agent frameworks, where multiple specialized agents interact to simulate medical
teamwork [ 40,18,42,5]. By fostering diverse reasoning paths and encouraging dissent, these
frameworks aim to improve decision quality, particularly in complex cases.
However, achieving effective collaboration among LLM agents for clinical decision making remains
a significant challenge. In practice, we observe a phenomenon we call Silent Agreement ,where a
group of medical agents converge prematurely on the same diagnosis, without debate, evaluation,
or exploration of alternatives. Figure 1 shows an example clinical misdiagnosis caused by Silent

Figure 1: An example clinical misdiagnosis case resulted from Silent Agreement . Although the
agents initially select different options, they remained silent in subsequent discussion, resulting in the
misdiagnosis. Our method actively disrupts such silent agreement with the designated catfish agent
in multi-agent collaborative reasoning and successfully produces the correct outcome.
Agreement. Although the agents initially propose different options, no further perspectives are
offered, and all agents remain silent in the discussion, ultimately leading to an incorrect diagnosis.
Silent Agreement mirrors a classic failure mode of human groups, often called “groupthink”, where
individuals suppress dissent and converge on a superficial consensus, often leading to sub-optimal
or even dangerous decisions [ 14]. In contrast, social science research shows that constructive
disagreement can enhance group performance, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine, by
surfacing overlooked evidence and reducing errors [ 28,26]. Structured dissent and open debate have
also been linked to more robust scientific outcomes and deeper reasoning in collaborative settings [ 37].
Motivated by these findings, we investigate how dissent can mitigate premature consensus in multi-
agent clinical decision making. We identify Silent Agreement as a critical bottleneck, highlighting
the need for deeper reasoning by promoting regulated, constructive disagreement.
In this paper, we develop a new concept, namely Catfish Agent , which is designed to actively disrupt
silent agreement in multi-agent collaborative reasoning for clinical decision making. Inspired by the
“catfish effect”1and the “devil’s advocate” strategy in organizational psychology research [ 24,27,2],
we propose to organize multi-agent reasoning as a multi-round, multi-role process.
Integrating dissent into medical agent groups poses two key challenges: (i) the level of required
autonomy varies with case complexity, and (ii) overly assertive dissent can derail discussion or
obscure key evidence. To address these issues, we formulate two core mechanisms in Catfish Agent:
(i) Complexity-aware intervention, i.e., the agent adapts its engagement based on task difficulty,
increasing autonomy in more complex cases to encourage deeper reasoning, and (ii) Tone-calibrated
intervention, in which the strength and tone of dissent vary with the level of agent agreement, avoiding
both passivity and excessive disruption. These novel mechanisms encourage the Catfish Agent to
“break the silence,” while preserving productive collaboration.
Figure 1 shows an example case, where the Catfish Agent disrupts premature consensus by criti-
cally challenging the expert assumptions. This intervention prompts a revision of initial reasoning
and enables the framework to synthesize a more reliable diagnosis. We evaluate our method on
nine medical question-answering (Q&A) [ 15,16,34,46,19,54,12,3] and three medical visual

sardines to keep them alive. Without stimulation, sardines often become sluggish and suffocate to death due to
lack of oxygen; however, the presence of a catfish keeps them constantly moving and thus alive.
2question-answering (VQA) benchmarks [ 54,52,11], comparing it with both single-agent LLMs
(e.g., GPT-4o [ 1], DeepSeek-R1 [ 10], HuatuoGPT-o1 [ 4]) and multi-agent medical frameworks ( e.g.,
MedAgent [ 40], MDAgent [ 18]). Experimental results show that our method achieves a 12.73-
point improvement on average, corresponding to a 39.2% relative gain over the best prior model,
DeepSeek-R1, on the Q&A benchmarks, and a 5.33-point improvement on average, representing a
12.7% relative gain over the best prior method, MDAgent, on the VQA benchmarks. We will release
our code, experimental results, and logs. Our contributions are threefold:
•We identify and formally define the Silent Agreement problem in LLM-based multi-agent frame-
works for clinical decision making.
•We present the new concept Catfish Agent , the first to inject structured dissent into medical
multi-agent systems, using the proposed complexity-aware andtone-calibrated interventions to
break Silent Agreement and enhance collaborative clinical reasoning.
•We conduct extensive experiments on nine medical Q&A and three medical VQA benchmarks,
demonstrating that our method largely outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-agent models.

Multi-Agent LLM for Medical Decision Making (MDM). Recent studies have applied multi-
agent LLM frameworks to collaborative tasks in planning, coding, and healthcare [ 53,49,18],
typically assigning complementary roles to agents to support multi-turn coordination. AutoGen [ 49]
formalizes inter-agent communication for iterative reasoning, while MDAgents [ 18] models medical
teams with role-specialized agents for diagnostic support. However, most approaches emphasize
cooperation over critique, assuming alignment leads to better decisions. In practice, we identify
a critical failure mode called Silent Agreement , where agents prematurely converge on diagnoses
without considering alternative hypotheses or resolving evidence conflicts. Recent works explore
multi-agent debate [44, 22, 17, 43], but often overlook silent agreement.
Large Language Models for Medical Reasoning. LLMs have demonstrated growing capabilities in
clinical reasoning, question answering, and medical summarization tasks [ 29,23,41]. Models like
[1,10,4,41,30,32,20,33,36,9,7] have achieved strong performance on benchmarks like MedQA
[15] and PubMedQA [ 16]. Recent work has begun exploring interaction-based improvements,
including CoT prompting and collaborative diagnosis [ 21,18]. Nevertheless, current methods rarely
address the group-level dynamics of agreement or disagreement. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to identify and mitigate the silent agreement bias in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks
for medical decision making through a new structured role-based intervention, i.e., Catfish Agent.
3 The Silent Agreement Problem
We start this research work by carefully studying the prevalence and impact of Silent Agreement, a
critical failure mode in multi-agent medical LLM frameworks, where agents converge on an answer,
often incorrect, without sufficient deliberation or justification. This behavior undermines the intended
collaborative nature of multi-agent reasoning and introduces risks in medical decision making.
To assess this issue, we analyze the hard set from MedAgentBench [ 39], focusing on two widely-used
benchmarks: MedQA [ 15] and PubMedQA [ 16]. We evaluate two prominent multi-agent frameworks,
MedAgents [ 40] and MDAgents [ 18], along with our proposed method. A silent agreement failure is
defined as a diagnostic error, where agents produce a final answer without meaningful discussion,
critique, or verification.
As shown in Table 1, MedAgents and MDAgents exhibit high silent rates, over 61.0% on both
datasets, indicating frequent non-response or unjustified consensus. More critically, a large portion of
their diagnostic failures are attributable to silent agreement: for MedAgents, 61.9% of failures on
MedQA and 90.7% on PubMedQA; for MDAgents, 68.1% and 64.0%, respectively. These patterns
confirm that silent agreement is not a rare anomaly but a dominant failure type in existing methods.
Chi-squared tests [ 35] further confirm that silent agreement significantly impacts diagnostic accuracy
3Table 1: Silent behavior analysis across MedQA and PubMedQA. “Silent Rate” denotes the proportion
of questions, where agents arrive at a final answer with silent agreement. “Failure Attribution Rate”
refers to the proportion of diagnostic failures that result from silent agreement. Our method achieves
both the lowest silent rate and the lowest attribution to silent agreement failures.

p= 0.0152 ), revealing a strong association between silent agreement and diagnostic failures.2
In contrast, our method achieves a significantly lower silent rate: 17.0% on MedQA and 11.0%
on PubMedQA. Moreover, among the failures, our method makes only 18.0% and 14.3% involve
silent agreement, substantially lower than those of MedAgents and MDAgents. This result indicates
that our framework not only reduces unjustified silence but also encourages agents to engage in
meaningful deliberation. Importantly, shifting away from silent behavior aligns with improved
diagnostic accuracy, as our method outperforms existing multi-agent frameworks; see Table 3 for
more details. The underlying mechanism is detailed in the next section.
4 Catfish Agent: Breaking Silent Agreement in LLM Teams
To address the Silent Agreement problem in LLM-based multi-agent clinical reasoning, we draw
inspiration from organizational psychology, where structured disagreement has been shown to enhance
epistemic vigilance and decision accuracy in human teams. Translating this principle to LLM-based
teams introduces two key challenges: (i) the necessary level of dissent varies with case complexity ,
and (ii) overly aggressive disagreement can derail discussion or obscure key evidence.
To address these challenges, we design the Catfish Agent with two core mechanisms: (i) a complexity-
aware intervention strategy that adapts the agent’s behavior to the difficulty of the clinical case, and
(ii) a tone-calibrated intervention mechanism that adjusts the rhetorical strength of dissent based
on the level of group agreement. The complexity-aware intervention strategy adaptively controls
the Catfish Agent’s degree of autonomy based on task difficulty (basic, intermediate, advanced), as
assessed by the Moderator. It governs when andhow much the agent should intervene in potential
groupthink. In contrast, the tone-calibrated intervention mechanism determines how the dissent is
expressed, ensuring interventions are context-sensitive and constructively framed. Figure 2 illustrates
the overall workflow of our framework involving the Catfish Agent, while Sections 4.1 and 4.2
present the details in the two core mechanisms.
4.1 Catfish in the Tiers: Stratifying Intervention by Complexity
Clinical tasks vary in complexity, with simple cases yielding quick consensus and complex cases
requiring deeper reasoning. Therefore, this complexity-aware intervention strategy is proposed to
dynamically adjusts the Catfish Agent’s behavior based on case difficulty. In complex or ambiguous
scenarios, the Catfish Agent is granted a stronger sense of independent judgment. Conversely, in
simpler cases, its interventions are more limited and guided. The following describes how the Catfish
Agent’s behavior is progressively liberated according to different levels of case complexity.
Basic cases. For low-complexity clinical questions, the Moderator independently formulates an
initial diagnosis D. The Catfish Agent then performs a lightweight critique, reviewing the reasoning
behind Dto identify any overlooked differentials or incomplete justification. If meaningful issues are
detected, it generates a comment for the Moderator’s reference when making the final diagnosis F.
Intermediate cases. In these cases, the Moderator first recruits a group of expert agents A. Specifi-
cally, the Catfish Agent Cis recruited alongside other agents, who is restricted to a predefined area
of expertise due to its assigned role as determined by the Moderator. As shown in Figure 1, during
2Statistically significant at p <0.05
4the group debate, the Catfish Agent is responsible for monitoring group dynamics and introducing
dissent when appropriate.
The reasoning process unfolds over multiple rounds, each consisting of several turns. First, before
the initial round begins, all recruited agents, excluding C, independently generate initial diagnoses
D, which are sequentially shared for peer review. Second, in each round i, the process proceeds
through a series of turns t. In each turn, agents sequentially evaluate the latest collective responses
Ri,t−1and contribute updated outputs Ri,tbased on their domain expertise. The first turn of the
first round is grounded in D. Third, Cmonitors turn-level responses for logical inconsistencies,
missed differentials, or weak justifications, aiming to detect emerging Silent Agreement. Upon
identifying such issues, it injects domain-specific perturbations as assigned by the Moderator. Fourth,
the rhetorical strength of these interventions ( e.g., mild, moderate, strong) is modulated based on
the perceived degree of group convergence. Agents targeted by these challenges may revise their
responses if they find the intervention sufficiently compelling. Last, at the end of each round, a
Summary Agent compiles a structured report Rithat aggregates the group’s updated reasoning.
The reasoning process terminates under one of two conditions: (i) all agents reach consensus or
fall into Silent Agreement, and two consecutive interventions by the Catfish Agent fail to provoke
meaningful divergence; or (ii) the discussion reaches a predefined limit of nrounds, with each round
allowing up to tinteraction turns. Last, the Moderator reviews the interaction log and optionally
consults intermediate summaries. The Catfish Agent may intervene if superficial consensus or
diagnostic gaps emerge. The final decision Fis made by the Moderator, integrating cross-round
insights and catfish feedback with critical awareness.
Advanced cases. For high-complexity diagnostic tasks, the Moderator initiates a hierarchical team-
of-teams structure. As illustrated in Figure 2, multiple teams tj={a1, a2, . . . , a m}are recruited,
each composed of domain-specific agents and led by a team leader. Within each team, the leader
assigns sub-tasks to members, who collaborate to generate a structured report. Teams then take turns
presenting their findings, allowing for cross-team comparison and integrative reasoning.
In the highest-complexity scenarios, the Catfish Agent C∗evolves into a free-roaming entity capable
of independently initiating dissent with self-determined roles and perspectives. First, upon detecting
Silent Agreement or conversational bias, C∗adopts an appropriate medical persona ( e.g., a Senior
Gastrointestinal Oncologist with 20+ years of experience in colorectal malignancies) and issues
context-sensitive challenges or counterarguments. Second, these interventions are integrated into the
team’s workflow, resulting in updated reasoning traces. Third, the team’s structured report is then
passed sequentially to the next team tj+1, enabling cumulative refinement across teams. Unlike the
fixed-role Catfish Cin intermediate settings, C∗dynamically traverses teams, contributing from a
broader, cross-domain perspective rather than being constrained to a predefined specialty. Last, once
allmteams have completed their contributions, the Moderator synthesizes the aggregated insights
and, if necessary, introduces a final Catfish Agent to conduct cross-team critique before producing
the final diagnosis F. This process ensures both in-depth intra-team deliberation and cross-team
integration before final decision making.
To sum up, benefiting from our complexity-aware intervention strategy, the Catfish Agent exhibits a
progressively independent mindset and structural influence across basic, intermediate, and advanced
cases, aligning with the increasing complexity of diagnostic scenarios.
4.2 Catfish in the Tone: Scaling Dissent by Consensus Strength
In collaborative diagnostic reasoning, the challenge is not only deciding when andhow much to
introduce dissent, but also how to express it, specifically, determining the appropriate degree of
rhetorical intensity to ensure disagreement is constructive rather than disruptive. Early convergence
among agents may indicate either well-founded consensus or premature closure. The core challenge
lies in calibrating dissent: if too weak, it may be ignored; if too strong, it risks disrupting constructive
reasoning or derailing the diagnostic process .
This tone-calibrated intervention mechanism is proposed to address this underexplored problem. It
can allows the Catfish Agent dynamically adjusts the rhetorical intensity in response to the strength
of inter-agent consensus. This mechanism enables context-sensitive dissent that preserves epistemic
rigor without compromising team coherence. We introduce different tones of intervention as follows:

......Figure 2: Overview of the reasoning process for an advanced case. (i) the system routes the clinical
question through a complexity-aware Moderator, which classifies it as advanced and activates three
expert teams, each consisting of a leader and two members; (ii) within each team, the leader assigns
specific subtasks, and members respond independently based on their expertise; (iii) a Catfish Agent
monitors the discussion and selectively intervenes by critiquing flawed assumptions or incomplete
reasoning. All team members are required to respond to these challenges; (iv) after internal discussion,
each team leader finalizes the team’s answer and forwards it to the next team for iterative refinement;
and (v) once all teams have contributed, the Moderator synthesizes the collective reasoning and, if
needed, introduces an additional Catfish Agent for final diagnosis.
Mild interventions. This type of intervention targets scenarios in which agents begin to converge
prematurely, relying on minimal or shallow evidence. In such cases, the Catfish Agent initiates reflec-
tive, non-confrontational prompts to gently encourage broader consideration. These interventions
aim to stimulate metacognitive reflection without disrupting group cohesion.
Intermediate interventions. This level of intervention is intended for scenarios in which con-
clusions are formed without robust supporting evidence. The Catfish Agent probes with targeted
questions, applying constructive pressure to surface hidden assumptions. This strategy draws inspi-
ration from Socratic inquiry and diagnostic timeout protocols [ 13,8] in the field of human clinical
decision making.
Strong interventions. This level of intervention targets cases of rapid, uncritical agreement among
agents. In such cases, the Catfish Agent delivers assertive challenges, explicitly questioning the
group’s reasoning to counteract conformity bias. This mode aligns with cognitive conflict theory and
the devil’s advocate paradigm.
Overall, this mechanism scales dissent according to consensus dynamics, ensuring interventions
are epistemically productive and collaboration-preserving, while avoiding unnecessary disruption in
simple scenarios and intensifying epistemic friction in high-stakes, complex cases.

5 Experimental Results
In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed Catfish Agent Framework on MedA-
gentsBench [ 39], a benchmark designed to assess complex medical reasoning. MedAgentsBench is
built from eight diverse medical Q&A datasets, including MedQA [ 15], PubMedQA [ 16], MedMCQA
[34], MedBullets [ 3], MedExQA [ 19], and MedXpertQA [ 54]. Note that MedXpertQA consists
of MedXpert-U and MedXpert-R, with each subset focusing on understanding and reasoning. It
also integrates six medical tasks from MMLU [ 12] and MMLU-Pro [ 46]. Based on performance
and reasoning depth, challenging “hard” subsets are selected. For a fair comparison, we follow the
standardized evaluation protocol and use the officially results reported by MedAgentsBench [39].
Implementation details. All experiments are conducted via the OpenAI API3in a strict zero-shot
setting, without any fine-tuning or gradient updates. Each agent, the Moderator, Catfish Agent,
and domain-specific Experts, is instantiated through separate API calls, with roles defined by struc-
tured prompts incorporating system instructions and dialogue history. Default API parameters
(temperature ,top_p ) are employed, with no explicit constraint on max_tokens .
5.1 Comparison with General and Medical Large Models
We compare our method using o3-mini [ 33] as the base model for each agent with the state-of-the-art
general large models, including GPT-4o-mini [ 30], GPT-4o [ 31], DeepSeek-V3 [ 20], o1-mini [ 32],
o3-mini [ 33], QwQ-32B [ 36], DeepSeek-R1 [ 10], Llama-3.3-70B [ 9], Claude-3.5-S [ 7], and Claude-
3.5-H [ 7], as well as specific medical models, including HuatuoGPT-o1 [ 4] and Baichuan-M1 [ 41].
Notably, we are the first to integrate a reasoning model, namely o3-mini, into a multi-agent framework
for medical decision making.
Table 2 presents the performance of our approach on MedAgentsBench, in comparison with a
broad range of general-purpose and medical-specialized large language models, focusing on the
“hard” subsets requiring demand deeper reasoning. Our method consistently achieves state-of-the-
art performance across all benchmarks, surpassing the second-best model by a substantial margin,
yielding an average 12.7-point absolute gain, corresponding to a 39.2% relative improvement4over
the best prior model, DeepSeek-R1 .
Additionally, we have the following observations. (i) Our method is the first to integrate CoT-style
reasoning into a structured multi-agent framework that supports multi-turn deliberation under

4The overall average accuracy improvement is computed by first averaging accuracy across all tasks and then
calculating the relative gain over DeepSeek-R1, resulting in a 39.2% improvement.

complex clinical conditions. By embedding CoT reasoning into each agent’s decision process and
introducing structured dissent via a Catfish Agent, our system not only improves diagnostic accuracy
but also offers a novel paradigm for modeling disagreement, iterative reasoning, and collaboration,
which are the key characteristics of expert clinical teams. (ii) Reasoning-based LLMs substan-
tially outperform standard LLMs across all medical benchmarks. For example, o3-mini and
DeepSeek-R1 achieve significantly higher accuracy than their non-reasoning counterparts, indicating
that explicit intermediate reasoning steps, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), are highly effective in
complex medical tasks. (iii) General-purpose reasoning models consistently outperform domain-
specialized medical LLMs. Despite lacking medical-specific pretraining, models like o3-mini
andDeepSeek-R1 surpass medical-tuned models such as HuatuoGPT-o1 andBaichuan-M1 across
nearly all datasets. This suggests that broad reasoning capabilities provide greater benefits than
narrow domain knowledge, especially in high-level diagnostic tasks such as MedXpertQA.
5.2 Comparison with Multi-Agent, Prompting, and Search-Agent Methods
Table 4: Comparison of three medical VQA
datasets requiring image-text reasoning. Our
method consistently outperforms GPT-4o and
multi-agent baselines.
Method MedXpert-MM PMC-VQA Path-VQA
GPT-4o 24.0% 32.0% 42.0%
MedAgents 24.0% 42.0% 48.0%
MDAgents 28.0% 54.0% 44.0%
Ours 34.0% 58.0% 50.0%We compare our method with three strate-
gies: (i) prior multi-agent LLM frameworks
(MedAgents, MDAgents), (ii) prompting-based
methods (baseline-prompting and advanced-
prompting), and (iii) search-agent systems,
across eight challenging medical Q&A datasets
under both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o settings.
As shown in Table 3, our method achieves state-
of-the-art accuracy on most datasets, outper-
forming all other methods in 12 of the 18 eval-
uation columns. We summarize our findings as follows: (i) Robust gains across all datasets.
Our method outperforms prior multi-agent approaches in all 18 comparisons (nine datasets ×two
base models), demonstrating strong generalization across diverse tasks and domains. (ii) Superior
reasoning under limited model capacity. On GPT-4o-mini, our method surpasses all previous
multi-agent methods by a significant margin. For instance, on MMLU-Pro (4o-mini), we achieve
32.0%, far exceeding MedAgents (3.0%) and MDAgents (9.0%), highlighting the effectiveness of
our disturbance-enhanced collaboration even with weaker backbones. (iii) Bridging the multi-agent
performance gap. Multi-agent frameworks typically struggle on benchmarks such as MMLU-Pro
and MedXpert-R, with prior methods ( e.g., MDAgent) achieving only 8.0% on MMLU-Pro (4o)
and 4.0% on MedXpert-R (4o). In contrast, our method achieves 50.0% and 21.0% respectively,
outperforming all agent-based baselines and matching or exceeding strong prompting and search-
based alternatives. (iv) Limits of multi-agent methods on simpler cases. On the MMLU subset, all

w/ Catfish in Moderator only 39.0% 33 51.5% (17/33) 37.5% (6/16)

w/ Catfish (Full Design) 50.0% 35 17.1% (6/35) 55.2% (16/29)
multi-agent methods show suboptimal performance due to the simplicity of many test cases. Most
samples in this subset are basic queries that require limited reasoning, reducing the benefits of agent
collaboration.
5.3 Comparison on Medical Visual Question Answer Tasks
To assess generalization beyond text-based Q&A, we evaluate our method on medical VQA tasks
requiring joint reasoning over clinical images and text. Experiments are conducted on three datasets:
MedXpert-MM [ 54], PMC-VQA [ 52], and PathVQA [ 11]. For each, we select 50 samples balanced
by complexity: 12 basic, 25 intermediate, and 13 advanced cases, enabling comprehensive evaluation
across difficulty levels.
As shown in Table 4, our method outperforms both the GPT-4o baseline (the base model of our
agents) and prior multi-agent frameworks across all benchmarks. On MedXpert-MM, it achieves 34%,
exceeding MedAgents and MDAgents by ten and six points, respectively. Similar improvements have
been seen on PMC-VQA and Path-VQA. These gains demonstrate our method’s superior multimodal
reasoning, particularly under visual ambiguity.
5.4 Ablation Study
To assess the contribution of each component in our framework, we conduct ablation studies on the
MedQA dataset using GPT-4o as the base agent model. Following our earlier categorization, we
focus on intermediate questions, where silent agreement behavior is most likely to occur, unlike
basic cases (single-agent) and advanced ones (forced responses). For each setting, we report: (i) the
number of intermediate cases, (ii) overall accuracy, (iii) silent agreement rate, which is defined as the
proportion of intermediate cases with no agent response, and (iv) accuracy on non-silent intermediate
cases. All silence-related metrics are computed exclusively within the intermediate subset, where
such dynamics are more observable.
Placement of the Catfish Agent. We investigate the effectiveness of Catfish Agent placements
through four configurations: (i) no Catfish Agent (baseline), (ii) embedded in the Moderator only, (iii)
embedded in the Team only, and (iv) embedded in both Moderator and Team (our full configuration).
As shown in Table 5, introducing the Catfish Agent in either location reduces Silent Agreement and
improves accuracy. The best results are achieved when the Catfish Agent is placed in both roles,
yielding the highest non-silent accuracy (55.2%) and the lowest silent rate (17.1%). These results
underscore the complementary value of combining top-down (Moderator) and peer-level (Team)
interventions to mitigate silent consensus and foster deeper discussion.
Tone of the Catfish Agent. We investigate whether the Catfish Agent’s tone impacts its effectiveness
by comparing a neutral variant with a strategically challenging one, as detailed in Sec. 4.2, while
keeping the agent embedded in both the Team and Moderator. As shown in Table 5, the use of
deliberate tone strategies yields higher overall accuracy (50% vs. 45%), reduces the Silent Agreement
rate (17.1% vs. 23.3%), and improves non-silent case accuracy (55.2% vs. 45.5%). This highlights
tone modulation as a key factor in disrupting premature consensus and encouraging active discussion.
6 Case Study
6.1 Advanced Case
As illustrated in Figure 3, the diagnostic process begins with multiple specialized teams, each
producing structured reports through intra-team collaboration. The Catfish Agent C∗monitors
interactions and dynamically intervenes when Silent Agreement or conversational bias is detected. It
9selects an expert role it considers most appropriate (e.g., nephrologist in Figure 3) to raise challenges
or provide counterpoints. These interventions are addressed by the team and incorporated into the
reasoning trace. The updated report is then passed to the next team for further refinement. After all
teams contribute, the Moderator aggregates the insights and, if needed, the Catfish Agent performs a
final cross-team critique before the Moderator issues the final decision.
Question: A 43-year-old woman with obesity is being assessed for stage 3B chronic kidney disease.
She has a 26-year history of type 1 diabetes managed with insulin and hypertension treated with
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily and lisinopril 40 mg daily. Her blood pressure is currently 140/84
mm Hg. Laboratory results show a serum creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL (reference range, 0.6–1.1)
and a serum potassium level of 4.9 mEq/L (3.5–5.0). Proteinuria is confirmed with an albumin-
to-creatinine ratio of 760 mg/g (<30). Which of the following management strategies is the most
appropriate for this patient? Options: (A) Replace hydrochlorothiazide with dapagliflozin; (B) Add
hydralazine to current therapy; (C) Add losartan to current therapy; (D) Increase lisinopril dosage
beyond 40 mg daily; (E) Add metoprolol to current therapy; (F) Replace hydrochlorothiazide with
canagliflozin; (G) Add amlodipine to current therapy; (H) Replace lisinopril with spironolactone; (I)
Replace hydrochlorothiazide with furosemide; (J) Initiate sodium bicarbonate therapy.
6.2 Intermediate Case
As shown in Figure 4, a group of expert agents is first recruited, including the Catfish Agent, which
is assigned a specific medical role by the Moderator. Each expert independently provides an initial
judgment and proposes a preliminary diagnosis. This is followed by multiple rounds of structured
debate. During each round, agents sequentially review the initial diagnosis report and are invited to
join the discussion by contributing their own perspectives if they disagree or have additional insights.
Throughout the process, the Catfish Agent monitors for signs of Silent Agreement, overlooked
differentials, insufficient justifications, and logical inconsistencies. When such issues arise, the
Catfish Agent injects domain-specific challenges calibrated to the group’s level of convergence.
Targeted agents may revise their responses if they find the critique valid. After each round, a
Summary Agent compiles an updated diagnostic report reflecting the latest viewpoints.
The discussion process terminates once consensus is reached, no substantial divergence follows
Catfish interventions, or a predefined round limit is met. Finally, the Moderator makes the ultimate
diagnostic decision, optionally consulting the Catfish Agent for additional critique before finalizing
the output.
Question: A 24-year-old woman, 8 weeks pregnant, attends her first prenatal visit. She recently
immigrated from Africa, has no vaccination records, and works as a babysitter with recent exposure
to children with flu and chickenpox. She reports only mild fatigue and nausea. Vitals and physical
exam are normal. Which vaccine should she receive now?
Options: (A) Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis vaccine; (B) Rabies vaccine; (C) Measles/Mumps/Rubella
vaccine; (D) Live-attenuated influenza vaccine; (E) Varicella vaccine; (F) Human papillomavirus
vaccine; (G) Intramuscular flu vaccine; (H) Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; (I) Hepatitis A vaccine;
(J) Hepatitis B vaccine.
6.3 Basic Case
As shown in Figure 5, this case demonstrates a successful intervention in a basic-complexity question.
The Moderator initially provides an incorrect diagnosis D, but the Catfish Agent identifies a flaw in
the reasoning and offers a concise critique. With this feedback, the Moderator revises the decision
and ultimately makes the correct final diagnosis F.
6.4 Visual Question Answering Case
Figure 6 presents a successful example where the Catfish Agent injects a targeted perturbation during
visual question answering, prompting domain experts to reconsider their initial conclusion. This
leads to a course correction and ultimately results in the correct diagnosis.

O ther De b a t e S t a g e ,  C a tf ish A g en t I n t er v en tio ns an d  F ina l  Decisi o n S t a g eFigure 4: Intermediate case example illustrating interventions from the Catfish Agent during a
multi-round debate. Assigned a fixed domain role, the Catfish Agent monitors team dynamics and
raises structured dissent to prevent Silent Agreement, enhancing diagnostic robustness.
6.5 Comparison with DeepSeek-R1
To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the Catfish Agent, we compare our framework with the
strongest baseline model, DeepSeek-R1 , using the same clinical question, as shown in Figure 7 and
Figure 8.
12In Figure 7, DeepSeek-R1 conducts a thorough analysis of all available options, yet ultimately fails
to select the correct answer. Moreover, it redundantly repeats reasoning patterns across options
without meaningful refinement.
In contrast, Figure 8 illustrates the final decision stage of our framework’s response to the same
question. Despite initial incorrect diagnosis among the expert groups, the Catfish Agent identifies
a critical flaw and proposes an effective alternative. This intervention successfully prompts the
Moderator to revise the initial judgment and reach the correct final decision.
6.6 Failure Case
Figure 9 illustrates a failure case in a basic-complexity question. Despite the Catfish Agent proposing
alternative diagnoses and constructively challenging the initial reasoning, the Moderator adheres to
the original answer without sufficient reconsideration. This ultimately results in an incorrect final
decision, underscoring that the Catfish’s interventions, while helpful, can still be overridden in rigid
decision-making scenarios.
7 Conclusion
We identify Silent Agreement as a critical failure mode in multi-agent LLM systems for clinical
decision making, where agents prematurely converge on diagnoses without sufficient critical analysis.
To address this, we present the new concept called Catfish Agent , a structured dissent mechanism
collaborative reasoning through dynamic, round-based interventions. By these new means, we
encourage deeper justification, broader hypothesis exploration, and more robust diagnostics, supported
by the proposed complexity-aware intervention strategy and tone-calibrated intervention mechanism.
Experiments on nine public medical Q&A datasets and three public medical VQA datasets show
substantial performance improvements. In the future, we plan to investigate efficient coordination
strategies that maintain reasoning depth while reducing the inference-time overhead.

(G) Addition of a cy t ot o xic alkyla ting chemother apeutic 
ag en t, such as cy clophosphamide
Ok a y , le t's t ackle this ques tion about... Fir s t, I need t o r emember wha t the ther apeutic r a tio means. Fr om wha t I r ec all, the ther apeutic r a tio...
The ques tion ask s which clinic al in t er v en tion is mos t lik ely t o decr ease this r a tio. The op tions ar e A thr ough J , each in v olving diff er en t ther apies or t echniques. Le t's g o thr ough them one b y one.
Op tion A: E GFR inhibit or s c an enhance the e ff ects of r adia tion in some c ancer s. It t ar g e ts c ancer cells mor e, thus incr easing the ther apeutic r a tio. 
Op tion B: If y ou inhibit DNA r epair , c ancer cells migh t be mor e suscep tible, but so migh t normal cells. W ait, but if the inhibit or is selectiv e f or c ancer cells, ma ybe it impr o v es the r a tio. If it's non-selectiv e, then normal cells c an't r epair either , leading t o mor e t o xicity . The ques tion doesn't specif y selectivity . Ma ybe this c ould decr ease the r a tio if it a ff ects normal cells t oo. Hmm.
Op tion C: Radiopr ot ect or s activ a t e be tt er in w ell-o xy g ena t ed normal tissues than in h ypo xic tumor s. This selectiv e pr ot ection c an r educe normal tissue damag e without a ff ecting tumor kill, impr o ving the ther apeutic r a tio , so C is not c orr ect.
Op tion D: Pr ot ons ha v e a Br ag g peak, meaning the y deposit mos t ener gy a t a cert ain dep th, sparing surr ounding tissues. This should allo w higher doses t o tumor with less normal tissue damag e, incr easing ther apeutic r a tio. So D w ould impr o v e it, so not the ans w er .
Op tion E: Hypo xic cells r esis t r adia tion, but these drugs sensitiz e them, boos ting tumor kill in lo w -o xy g en ar eas without r aising normal tissue dose. This impr o v es the ther apeutic r a tio. So E is not c orr ect.
Op tion F: IMR T pr ecisely shapes r adia tion t o the tumor , sparing surr ounding normal tissue. This incr ease ther apeutic r a tio. So F is not the ans w er .
Op tion G: This is a cy t ot o xic drug. If giv en with r adia tion, it migh t ha v e additiv e or s yner gis tic e ff ects. Ho w e v er , if it's not selectiv e, it c ould incr ease t o xicity in normal tissues. If the chemo is giv en c oncurr en tly , it migh t enhance tumor killing but also incr ease side e ff ects. Depending on the balance, c ould either incr ease or decr ease ther apeutic r a tio. If the added t o xicity outw eighs the bene fit, the r a tio decr eases. But if tumor c on tr ol is much be tt er , r a tio migh t incr ease. Not sur e. Need t o think mor e.
Op tion H: If the r adiopr ot ect or c oncen tr a t es in w ell- v asculariz ed normal tissue but not in poorly v asculariz ed tumor s, it pr ot ects normal cells, impr o ving the ther apeutic r a tio.
Op tion I: Br oad-spectrum TKIs migh t in t erf er e with multiple pa th w a y s. Some TKIs c an pr ot ect normal cells or sensitiz e tumor cells. But if the y inhibit r epair mechanisms in normal cells, tha t c ould incr ease t o xicity . Alt erna tiv ely , if the y t ar g e t tumor -specific pa th w a y s, migh t help. Without specifics, har d t o sa y . But br oad-spectrum migh t a ff ect man y cells, possibly incr easing normal tissue damag e. Ma ybe this c ould lo w er ther apeutic r a tio. But not sur e.
Op tion J: This means giving smaller doses mor e fr equen tly . It c an r educe la t e side e ff ects b y allo wing normal tissues t o r epair be tw een doses. If t ot al dose is same or higher , tumor c on tr ol migh t be similar or be tt er with less t o xicity . This usually incr eases ther apeutic r a tio , so J is not the ans w er .
Back t o the op tions. The ques tion is which DE CRE ASE S the ther apeutic r a tio. So w e need an in t er v en tion tha t either r educes tumor killing or incr eases normal tissue damag e mor e than bene fit.
Op tion B: If these ar e giv en during r adia tion, the y w ould pr e v en t c ancer cells fr om r epairing DNA damag e, making r adia tion mor e e ff ectiv e. But if the y also inhibit r epair in normal cells, then normal tissues c an't fix the damag e either . If the inhibit or is non-selectiv e, this w ould incr ease t o xicity . F or e x ample, drugs lik e P ARP inhibit or s c an sensitiz e cells with cert ain mut a tions (lik e BR CA), but if used br oadly , the y migh t a ff ect normal cells t oo. If the ans w er assumes non-selectiv e, then B w ould decr ease the ther apeutic r a tio b y incr easing normal tissue damag e. But if the inhibit or is selectiv e f or c ancer cells (lik e t ar g e ting a r epair pa th w a y only activ e in c ancer), then B w ould help. The ques tion doesn't specif y , but the ans w er lik ely assumes non-selectiv e. So B c ould be a c andida t e.
Op tion G: This is a classic alkyla ting ag en t. When c ombined with r adia tion, it c an incr ease both tumor kill and t o xicity . If the added t o xicity is signific an t, the ther apeutic r a tio c ould decr ease. F or e x ample, if the c ombina tion leads t o mor e se v er e side e ff ects without a pr oportional incr ease in tumor c on tr ol, r a tio g oes do wn. Ho w e v er , in man y c ases, . But it's possible. The k e y is whe ther the added chemo's t o xicity outw eighs the bene fit.
Op tion I: If these inhibit pa th w a y s tha t ar e import an t f or normal cell r epair , then c ombining with r adia tion ma y mak e normal tissues mor e sensitiv e. F or e x ample, some TKIs a ff ect VE GF . If giv en c oncurr en tly , migh t incr ease r adia tion damag e in normal tissues. If so , ther apeutic r a tio decr eases.
But the mos t lik ely ans w er her e is  Bec ause if y ou inhibit DNA r epair , especially in normal cells, the y c an't fix the r adia tion-induced damag e, leading t o mor e t o xicity . If the tumor's r epair mechanisms ar e also inhibit ed, ma ybe the tumor is killed mor e, but if the normal cells ar e equally a ff ect ed, then the r a tio migh t not impr o v e. Ho w e v er , the ques tion is about DE CRE ASING the r a tio...
Another angle: The ther apeutic r a tio is the r a tio of tumor c on tr ol t o normal tissue c omplic a tions. T o decr ease it, either tumor c on tr ol is r educed or normal c omplic a tions ar e incr eased. DNA r epair inhibit or s giv en during r adia tion w ould enhance the r adia tion's e ff ect on both tumor and normal cells. If the inhibit or is equally e ff ectiv e in both, then both tumor kill and normal damag e incr ease. Whe ther the r a tio decr eases depends on which e ff ect is gr ea t er . If the tumor is mor e dependen t on DNA r epair , then ma ybe tumor kill incr eases mor e, r a tio impr o v es. But if normal tissues ar e also hea vily a ff ect ed, r a tio decr eases. But without kno wing selectivity , it's tricky .
Alt erna tiv ely , op tion C... only w ork in normal tissues with o xy g en... pr ot ect normal cells but not tumor ...  So C is not c orr ect.
Op tion H: Radiopr ot ect or in v ascular tissues. Ag ain, pr ot ects normal tissues, incr easing r a tio.
Op tion B: If DNA r epair inhibit or s ar e used, and the y w ork on both, but ma ybe the normal cells r ely mor e on those r epair pa th w a y s. F or e x ample, P ARP inhibit or s in cells with homolog ous r ec ombina tion de ficiency (lik e BR CA mut a tions) w ould be mor e e ff ectiv e in c ancer cells. But in the ab sence of such mut a tions, P ARP inhibit or s migh t not help much. If the inhibit or is non-selectiv e, then normal cells ar e mor e a ff ect ed. W ait, but DNA r epair inhibit or s ar e oft en used t o t ar g e t c ancer cells with de f ectiv e r epair mechanisms. If the inhibit or is giv en in a c ase wher e the tumor has in t act r epair , then it migh t not help. This is g e tting c omplic a t ed.
Op tion I: If the y inhibit r ecep t or s needed f or normal cell r epair , then mor e t o xicity . F or e x ample, if TKIs t ar g e t E GFR which is in v olv ed in healing , then c ombining with r adia tion c ould lead t o mor e se v er e skin r eactions, muc ositis, e t c. This w ould incr ease normal tissue damag e, decr easing ther apeutic r a tio. So I is possible.
Op tion G: Cy clophosphamide is alkyla ting , c auses DNA cr osslink s. Adding it t o r adia tion c ould incr ease DNA damag e in both tumor and normal cells. If the c ombina tion is mor e t o xic, r a tio decr eases. But cy clophosphamide is oft en used with r adia tion in r egimens lik e f or lymphomas, but the ther apeutic r a tio depends on the balance.
But g oing back t o the ques tion, the c orr ect ans w er is lik ely . If y ou inhibit DNA r epair , then r adia tion-induced damag e isn't r epair ed, making both tumor and normal cells mor e suscep tible. Ho w e v er , if the inhibit or is mor e e ff ectiv e in tumor cells, the r a tio impr o v es. But if it's equally e ff ectiv e, then both tumor kill and normal damag e incr ease. Ho w e v er , in r eality , DNA r epair inhibit or s ar e oft en used in tumor s with specific r epair de ficiencies, so the y ha v e a selectiv e e ff ect. But if the ques tion doesn't specif y tha t, and it's a g ener al DNA r epair inhibit or , then it w ould decr ease the ther apeutic r a tio b y making normal cells mor e sensitiv e. 
W ait, but another angle: The ther apeutic r a tio is about the diff er ence be tw een tumor and normal tissue r esponse. If the DNA r epair inhibit or mak es the tumor mor e sensitiv e than normal tissues, r a tio incr eases. If it mak es both equally mor e sensitiv e, the r a tio s t a y s the same... The ques tion is which in t er v en tion decr eases the r a tio. So if the inhibit or a ff ects normal tissues mor e, r a tio decr eases. But DNA r epair inhibit or s ar e usually designed t o t ar g e t c ancer cells. Ho w e v er , if giv en without selectivity , the y w ould a ff ect all cells. F or e x ample, an inhibit or of base e x cision r epair migh t a ff ect both. If the tumor is r elying mor e on tha t pa th w a y , then ma ybe the inhibit or help s. But if normal cells ar e also dependen t, then t o xicity incr eases. If the ne t r esult is tha t normal tissue damag e incr eases mor e than tumor kill, r a tio decr eases.
Alt erna tiv ely , the ans w er c ould be C: ... But in this c ase...  Another op tion: op tion E...  So E is not the ans w er . Op tion J ... so not the ans w er .
So the mos t pr obable ans w er is . Bec ause if y ou inhibit DNA r epair in normal cells, the y c an't fix r adia tion damag e, leading t o mor e t o xicity . E v en if the tumor is also a ff ect ed, if the incr ease in normal tissue damag e is gr ea t er than the incr ease in tumor kill, the ther apeutic r a tio decr eases. Ther e f or e, B decr eases the r a tio.

Critic al Analy sis o f  K e y Op tions 
 (B) Addition of DNA r epair inhibit or s: Radia tion induces DNA damag e, and r epair inhibit or s block cellular mechanisms (e. g., base e x cision r epair , homolog ous r ec ombina tion) tha t mitig a t e this damag e. If these 
inhibit or s ar e   non - selectiv e, the y impair DNA r epair in   both tumor and normal cells. While tumor cells ma y be mor e vulner able due t o r apid pr olif er a tion, normal tissues (e. g., bone marr o w , g as tr oin t es tinal

[Ra tionale]:
Acc or ding t o the article, sauna use incr eases c ar diac output primarily b y r aising heart r a t e, not s tr ok e v olume, which r emains unchang ed. Thus, an incr ease in s tr ok e v olume is not iden tified as a bene fit of sauna use.
