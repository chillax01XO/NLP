Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automated techniques have been increasingly used to support
software developers by generating software artifacts such as code snippets, patches, and comments. However,
accurately assessing the correctness of these generated artifacts remains a significant challenge. On one hand,
human evaluation provides high accuracy but is labor-intensive and lacks scalability. While test-based metrics
(e.g., the widely used Pass@k) offer greater scalability, they still depend on the careful manual design of
comprehensive test cases that capture edge scenarios. On the other hand, other existing automatic evaluation
metrics are scalable and require minimal human effort, but they often fail to accurately reflect the actual
correctness of generated software artifacts.
In this paper, we present SWE-Judge , the first evaluation metric for LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge specifically
designed to accurately assess the correctness of generated software artifacts. SWE-Judge first defines five
distinct evaluation strategies, each implemented as an independent judge. A dynamic team selection mech-
anism then identifies the most appropriate subset of judges to produce a final correctness score through
ensembling. We evaluate SWE-Judge across a diverse set of software engineering (SE) benchmarks—including
CoNaLa, Card2Code, HumanEval-X, APPS, APR-Assess, and Summary-Assess—which span three SE tasks:
code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SWE-Judge consistently achieves a higher correlation with human judgments, with improvements ranging
from 5.9% to 183.8% over existing automatic metrics. Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels
with human annotators that are comparable to inter-annotator agreement in code generation and program
repair tasks. These findings underscore SWE-Judge’s potential as a scalable and reliable alternative to human
evaluation.

1 INTRODUCTION
The growing demand to automate software development tasks has led to the emergence of auto-
mated techniques for generating software artifacts, such as code snippets [ 2,35], code changes [ 13,
43], and summarization [ 30]. However, evaluating the correctness of those generated artifacts
remains a challenge, largely due to the existence of multiple correct or semantically equivalent
solutions for a given problem.
One accurate evaluation method is human evaluation, where multiple human experts directly
assess the correctness of the generated artifacts. However, human evaluation is labor-intensive and
time-consuming, making it impractical for large-scale assessments. An alternative is test-based
metrics, such as pass@k [ 2], where human experts manually design a set of test cases and the
generated code is then executed to check whether it passes these test cases. While test-based
metrics are more scalable than human evaluation, they still require the careful manual design of
comprehensive test cases that cover edge cases [ 16,44]. Designing complete test cases is tedious
and challenging itself, and many Software Engineering (SE) tasks lack the necessary test cases,
making test-based metrics not practical for large-scale evaluations.
To enable scalable evaluation of generated artifacts, several automatic evaluation metrics have
been proposed [ 25,27,37,41,45]. These metrics offer greater scalability by eliminating the need
for human evaluation or test cases. However, they are typically less accurate in assessing correct-
ness [ 11]. This study aims to advance automatic evaluation metrics to bridge the gap between
automated evaluation results and human judgment. These automatic metrics can generally be cate-
gorized into three types: 1) Match-based metrics , 2)Embedding-based metrics , and 3) LLM-as-judge
metrics . Match-based metrics, such as BLEU [ 25] and CodeBLEU [ 27], evaluate the similarity be-
tween the generated artifact and a reference, i.e., a correct answer. Embedding-based metrics [ 37,41],
on the other hand, also compare the generated artifact to a reference, but they first encode both
into embeddings and then measure the similarity between them. In contrast, the LLM-as-judge
metric [ 45] instructs the LLMs to judge the quality of the generated artifact. Despite the widespread
adoption of metrics above, they still suffer from two major limitations .
Interpreting Similarity as Correctness. Both match-based and embedding-based metrics use
similarity as an indicator of correctness. However, similarity does not always align with correct-
ness. For example, if the generated artifact is semantically equivalent to the reference but differs
significantly in syntax, the similarity scores would be low, failing to accurately reflect the correct-
ness. Additionally, Evtikhiev et al. [ 11] provided empirical evidence demonstrating a significant
misalignment between human judgment and match-based metrics.
Lack of Diverse Evaluation Strategies for Correctness Assessment. The state-of-the-art
(SOTA) LLM-as-judge evaluation metric for code, ICE-Score [ 45], instructs LLMs to directly assign
evaluation scores based on predefined criteria—natural language descriptions of correct and incor-
rect code. However, it primarily focuses on a single strategy, lacking diverse strategies to assess
correctness from different angles. A more comprehensive LLM-as-judge framework is needed to
integrate multiple evaluation strategies, ensuring a more reliable and robust assessment.
Our Work. To address these limitations, we propose SWE-Judge (SoftWarEJudge ), the first
LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge metric designed to assess the correctness of generated software artifacts,
including code snippets, patches, and summarization. Unlike match-based and embedding-based
, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: May 2025.An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks 3
metrics that approximate correctness through similarity, SWE-Judge, like other LLM-as-judge ap-
proaches, leverages LLMs’ reasoning and software comprehension abilities for semantic evaluation.
Inspired by the rigorous academic peer-review process [ 7], where multiple reviewers collaborate to
ensure an accurate assessment of a paper’s quality, SWE-Judge utilizes a multi-evaluator framework.
Specifically, SWE-Judge first defines five distinct evaluation strategies, each represented by an
independent evaluator responsible for its own correctness assessment strategy. Second, a dynamic
team-selection mechanism chooses the most suitable subset of evaluators. Third, the selected team
members conduct their assessments, and their results are aggregated to generate a final correctness
score through ensembling. This approach enhances the evaluation process by incorporating diverse
strategies and dynamically selecting a suitable team of judges, thereby improving the quality of the
automatic correctness assessment.
We evaluate SWE-Judge on a diverse set of SE datasets, including CoNaLa [ 11,36], Card2Code [ 11,
19], HumanEval-X [ 40], APPS [ 14], APR-Assess [ 15], and Summary-Assess [ 22,29]. These datasets
encompass three popular SE tasks, code generation [ 14,19,36,40], automated program repair [ 15],
and code comments [ 22,29], across five programming languages: Java, C++, Python, JavaScript,
and Go, and cover three different types of generated software artifacts: code snippets, patches, and
comments. Following prior work [ 11,45], we employ Kendall’s 𝜏coefficient, Spearman’s 𝑟𝑠, and
Pearson’s 𝑟𝑝to quantify the statistical correlation between the assessments made by SWE-Judge
and the ground truths, defined by either human evaluation results or test execution outcomes. The
experimental results illustrate that SWE-Judge achieves significantly and consistently higher corre-
lations (5.9%-183.8%) than the baselines. Moreover, SWE-Judge also achieves agreement levels with
human annotators that are comparable to inter-annotator agreement observed in code generation
and automated program repair. This underscores its potential to serve as a reliable substitute for
human evaluators in these tasks.
Contributions. The main contributions are as follows:
•To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge evaluation
metric for assessing diverse software artifacts. Our SWE-Judge is designed to integrate multi-
ple novel evaluation strategies proposed in this work, enabling a comprehensive and robust
correctness assessment.
•We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of SWE-Judge across five
programming languages (i.e., Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, and Go) and three types of software
artifacts (i.e., source code, code changes, and comments), and three popular generation-based SE
tasks: code generation, automated program repair, and code summarization.
•SWE-Judge significantly and consistently outperforms existing automatic evaluation metrics,
achieving new state-of-the-art performance.
2 PRELIMINARIES
2.1 Problem Statement
Automatic evaluation metrics aim to assess the quality of software artifacts generated by SE
automation tools. In this work, we focus specifically on the aspect of functional correctness ,
which refers to the extent to which a generated software artifact fulfills the intended functional
behavior described in the user requirement. Correctness is a fundamental and indispensable attribute
in many SE tasks. Without correctness, other desirable properties—such as efficiency or readability
are rendered secondary. Formally, the task is defined as follows and illustrated in 1of Figure 2.
Let𝑥denote a user’s requirement (e.g., a natural language description of a task), and let 𝑦be a
software artifact generated by an automated SE tool (e.g., an LLM-based code generator), intended
to fulfill the requirement 𝑥. Let 𝑟be a reference solution that correctly fulfills the user requirement
, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: May 2025.4 Xin Zhou, Kisub Kim, Ting Zhang, Martin Weyssow, Luís F. Gomes, Guang Yang, and David Lo
𝑥. For each generated software artifact 𝑦, human annotators provide a correctness score, e.g.,
𝑆∈{0,1,2,3,4}, where 0 indicates a completely incorrect software artifact and 4 indicates a fully
correct one. Our objective is to develop an automatic evaluation metric E(𝑥,𝑦, 𝑟)that can closely
correlate with the human-provided correctness score 𝑆.
2.2 State-of-the-Art Metric: ICE-Score
The state-of-the-art LLM-as-judge evaluation metric for code, ICE-Score [ 45], prompts LLMs
to directly assign evaluation scores to the generated software artifacts. Formally, it takes the
requirement 𝑥, the generated software artifact 𝑦, and the reference solution 𝑟, and inserts them
into a predefined prompt, yielding 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑡(𝑥,𝑦, 𝑟). The LLM then generates a score based on this
prompt: 𝑃=𝐿𝐿𝑀(𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑡(𝑥,𝑦, 𝑟)). We showcase the ICE-Score’s prompt for the code generation
task below:
Abstracted ICE-Score Prompt
[Task Description] Your task is to rate the code snippet only on one metric ...
[Evaluation Criteria] Functional Correctness (0-4) - Execution-based quality of the code
snippet combined with the problem ...
[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read the problem carefully;
2. Read the code snippet and compare it to the problem;
3. Assign a score for functional correctness on a scale of 0 to 4.
[Data] Problem: x, Code Snippet: y, Reference Code (Optional): r
The core idea behind ICE-Score is to directly “ask” the LLM to assess the correctness of the
generated code 𝑦, as reflected in instructions like “ Your task is to rate the code snippet ” and “ Assign
a score for functional correctness. ” This represents a straightforward strategy in using LLMs for
correctness evaluation, which we refer to as the “ Direct Assess ” strategy.
However, ICE-Score focuses solely on this strategy, leaving other potential strategies unexplored.
For example, one could prompt the LLM to determine whether the generated software artifact
𝑦is functionally equivalent to the reference solution 𝑟, with respect to the user requirement 𝑥.
Alternatively, the LLM could first generate test cases based on 𝑥, and then verify whether 𝑦passes
all those tests. To address this limitation, we propose SWE-Judge, which extends beyond the Direct
Assess strategy. SWE-Judge explores and integrates multiple evaluation strategies for assessing
correctness, leading to more accurate evaluation scores compared to ICE-Score.
2.3 Motivating Example
Our work is inspired by the rigorous academic peer-review process, as illustrated in Figure 1. In a
typical review process, authors submit a manuscript, after which the editor selects multiple suitable
reviewers to conduct peer review. Each reviewer independently provides their review and feedback,

which the editor then synthesizes into a final editorial decision. The high quality of this process
can largely be attributed to two factors: (1) the editor’s ability to select appropriate reviewers, and
(2) the professionalism of each individual reviewer.
Drawing an analogy to this process, a key limitation of ICE-Score is that it relies on only a single
“reviewer” (i.e., one evaluation strategy), without a pool of potential “reviewers” to select from.
Moreover, it lacks a mechanism to assemble a team of complementary reviewers that can produce
a more reliable evaluation. Motivated by this, our work proposes two core ideas:
•Designing diverse evaluation strategies to ensure variation in perspectives—similar to how
reviewers often bring different evaluation angles to peer review.
•Introducing a lightweight team assembly mechanism that selects an effective combination
of evaluation strategies, akin to the reviewer assignment step in the academic peer review.
3 OUR APPROACH
The framework of SWE-Judge is illustrated in Figure 2. Given a requirement 𝑥, a generated software
artifact 𝑦, and a reference solution 𝑟,SWE-Judge produces a correctness evaluation score E(𝑥,𝑦, 𝑟).
The framework consists of three main components: the first defines the evaluation strategies, the
second selects an appropriate team, which consists of a few evaluation strategies, and the third
performs the actual scoring.
Part 1: Diverse Evaluation Strategies ( 1of Figure 2). Given a requirement 𝑥, a generated
software artifact 𝑦, and a reference solution 𝑟, this component defines five distinct correctness
evaluation strategies to assess the correctness of the generated software artifact 𝑦from diverse
perspectives.
Part 2: Dynamic Team Formation ( 2of Figure 2). Given the five evaluation strategies, this
part aims to assemble an effective subset, referred to as a “team”, from these strategies. Importantly,
the team selection is performed dynamically for each dataset, allowing the assembled team to adapt
to the characteristics of different datasets.
Part 3: Correctness Score Generation ( 3of Figure 2). Once the team is determined, it is used
to evaluate the correctness of data samples in the evaluation dataset, generating individual scores
for each data sample. These individual scores are then aggregated to produce the final correctness
score.

3.1 Diverse Evaluation Strategies
Basics of Evaluation Strategy. Our tool is built upon the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs.
Specifically, we do not provide any human-annotated scores as input totheLLMs . Instead, for each
evaluation data sample, we construct prompts containing the user requirement 𝑥, the generated
software artifact 𝑦, and the reference solution 𝑟. These prompts are then fed into the LLM, which
generates a response score based on its assessment of the correctness of 𝑦.
Each unique prompt design corresponds to a distinct evaluation strategy. By pairing a specific
strategy’s prompt with an LLM, we form an evaluator that generates individual correctness scores
in a zero-shot fashion. We introduce the prompt designs of five different evaluation strategies as
follows:
Strategy 1: Direct Assess. Similar to the previous SOTA approach ICE-Score [ 45], Strategy 1 (P1)
directly asks the LLM to assess the correctness of the generated output 𝑦. Below, we present an
example of the prompt used in P1 for the code generation task. For the detailed prompts used in P1
across different datasets, please refer to our online replication package.
Prompt of Strategy 1
[Task Description] Your task is to rate the code snippet...
[Evaluation Criteria] Functional Correctness (0-4) - Execution-based quality of the code
snippet combined with the problem ...
[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read the problem carefully;
2. Read the code snippet and compare it to the problem;
3. Assign a score for functional correctness on a scale of 0 to 4.
[Data] Problem: x, Code Snippet: y, Reference Code (Optional): r
In Strategy 1, we can choose whether or not to provide the reference solution 𝑟in the data fields,
leading to two variants of Strategy 1, denoted as 𝑃1𝑎and𝑃1𝑏. In𝑃1𝑎, no reference solution is
provided, while in 𝑃1𝑏, the reference solution is included.
Strategy 2: Direct Assess and Rethink. Strategy 2 (P2) builds upon Strategy 1 (P1). In P1, the LLM
directly provides a correctness score ˆ𝑠1for the generated software artifact 𝑦, typically accompanied
by a brief explanation (1–2 sentences) justifying the assigned score. Inspired by the way humans
often reflect on their initial judgments, P2 introduces a rethink step. This step prompts the LLM to
review both its previously assigned score and the reasoning behind it, and to consider whether any
revision is necessary.
Concretely, the LLM is asked to critically re-evaluate the validity of its earlier explanation and
adjust its score accordingly. For example, suppose in P1 the LLM assigns a low score to the generated
software artifact 𝑦due to a flaw it identifies (e.g., a reason 𝑒). During the rethink phase, if the
LLM realizes that this reason 𝑒is actually incorrect, it is encouraged to revise the score upward.
Conversely, if the LLM initially gives a high score based on a positive justification 𝑒, but later
determines that 𝑒does not hold, it should lower the score accordingly in the rethink step. If the
LLM in the rethink step agrees on the previous reason 𝑒, then the score is unchanged. Below, we
present an example of the prompt used in P2 for the code generation task.

Prompt of Strategy 2

<Response from Strategy 1: predicted score ˆ𝑠1and its reasons 𝑒>

[Task Description] Your task is to recheck whether the reason and score are proper...
[Evaluation Criteria]
1. If a bad reason about the code snippet is validated to be ‘False’, increase the score a bit...
2. If a good reason about the code snippet is validated to be ‘False’, decrease the score a bit...
3. If a reason is validated to be ‘True’, then please do not change the score...
[Evaluation Steps]
1. Please only validate the previous score and reason.
2. Please reply with your adjusted score.
[Data] Problem: x, Code Snippet: y, Predicted Score from P1: ˆ𝑠1, Reasons from P1: e
After the rethink step, the LLM will produce an adjusted score ˆ𝑠2by either increasing, decreasing,
or maintaining the original correctness score generated in P1 ( ˆ𝑠1). For the detailed prompts used in
P2 and other strategies across different datasets, please refer to our online replication package.
Strategy 3: Equivalence Assess. Strategy 3 (P3) adopts a fundamentally different approach from
P1 and P2. Since the reference solution, 𝑟, can correctly satisfy the user requirement 𝑥, we can
assess the correctness of 𝑦by evaluating its equivalence to 𝑟. The underlying idea is that if 𝑦and𝑟
are semantically or functionally equivalent, then it is highly likely that 𝑦also meets the original
requirement 𝑥. Therefore, rather than reasoning directly on the correctness of 𝑦, the LLM focuses
on comparing 𝑦and𝑟, making this strategy an equivalence-based evaluation strategy. We present
an example of the prompt used in P3 for the code generation task:
Prompt of Strategy 3
[Task Description] Given two code implementations or code diffs, your task is to assess
whether they are semantically equivalent...
[Evaluation Criteria] Semantic Equivalence: To what extent do the two code versions
produce the same behavior...
[Evaluation Steps]
1. Read and analyze both code versions carefully. Read the problem description too...
2. Compare their functionality, structure, and logic to determine if they yield the same
output and behavior...
3. Assign a Semantic Equivalence score...
[Data] Problem: x, Code Snippet: y, Reference Code: r
Strategy 4: Generate Tests and Assess. Strategy 4 (P4) introduces another different evaluation
strategy. The core idea is straightforward: when the generated artifact 𝑦is a code snippet or a
code change, test cases serve as an effective means for assessing its correctness. Figure 3 illustrates
the prompt design for Strategy 4. This strategy consists of two steps. In the first step, we prompt
the LLM to generate test cases based on the user requirement 𝑥and the reference code 𝑟, as our
evaluation data does not include test cases in the input. In the second step, we provide the generated
software artifact 𝑦along with the previously generated test cases as input to the LLM. The LLM is
then asked to evaluate whether 𝑦can pass all the generated test cases and, based on this evaluation,
assign a correctness score.

Fig. 3. Prompt Designs of Strategy 4 and Strategy 5.
Strategy 5: Analyze Reference and Assess. Strategy 5 (P5) adopts an analytical approach. The
right side of Figure 3 illustrates the prompt design for Strategy 5. This strategy involves two steps.
First, the LLM identifies the critical properties of 𝑟that make it a correct solution for 𝑥. In the
second step, the LLM checks whether 𝑦preserves those core properties. If the LLM determines that
𝑦aligns with the reference solution’s key characteristics, it considers 𝑦to be correct.
Turning Strategies into Evaluators. With all strategies defined, we can now pair each strategy
with a specific LLM to construct a set of evaluators. Each evaluator produces an independent
correctness score according to its respective evaluation strategy. In addition, as the target human
score ranges vary across datasets such as CoNaLa [ 11,36] using a 0–4 scale, APR-Assess [ 15] using
0–1, and Summary-Assess [ 22,29] using 1–5, we standardize the output range across all strategies
to ensure consistency. To do this, we include an instruction in each prompt that constrains the LLM
to output a score within the 0–100 range. In a later stage of SWE-Judge (described in Section 3.3), we
apply a linear transformation to map the predicted score from the 0–100 range to the corresponding
range used by the evaluation dataset.
3.2 Dynamic Team Formation
Just like an academic peer-review process depends on selecting suitable reviewers to ensure the
quality of reviews, we argue that evaluating generated software artifacts similarly benefits from
assembling a well-matched team. Building on this insight, this component dynamically assembles
an effective team from the available 5 strategies, tailoring the combination to each dataset in order
to better align with its specific characteristics.
Initial Teaming. Although we have 5 evaluation strategies, Strategy 1 has two variants. Let
P={𝑃1𝑎, 𝑃1𝑏, 𝑃2, 𝑃3, 𝑃4, 𝑃5}denote the set of strategy variants we can choose from. We leverage
LLMs to automatically obtain correctness scores, allowing us to explore a broad space of strategy
combinations. Specifically, we consider all combinations that include at least two distinct strategies.
In principle, there areÍ6
𝑘=2 6
𝑘=57possible teams that can be formed from P. We denote these
combinations asT={𝑇1,𝑇2, . . . ,𝑇 57}.
, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: May 2025.An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks 9
Team Trials on A Few Annotated Samples. To identify the best team from T={𝑇1,𝑇2, . . . ,𝑇 57},
we utilize a small set of annotated examples from the evaluation dataset. We randomly sample 10
instances, assuming their ground truth correctness scores are available, as annotating this number
is feasible for a human developer. Each team generates predicted scores for these samples, and we
measure their alignment with the ground truth using Kendall’s 𝜏coefficient, Spearman’s 𝑟𝑠, and
Pearson’s 𝑟𝑝. The team with the highest correlation is selected as the best team for the dataset.
3.3 Final Correctness Score Generation
For illustration purposes, suppose the selected team 𝑇𝑖comprises strategies 𝑃1,𝑃2, and 𝑃3. Please
note that 𝑇𝑖=(𝑃1, 𝑃2, 𝑃3)is just an example.
Individual Score Prediction. Each sample 𝑑𝑖∈ D is represented as a tuple (𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑖, 𝑟𝑖). The
strategies in the selected team independently generate correctness scores for each sample, resulting
in three individual scores: 𝑠1,𝑠2, and 𝑠3, corresponding to 𝑃1,𝑃2, and 𝑃3, respectively.
Score Ensembling. To generate the final score for each sample, we aggregate the individual scores
from the team members using a simple averaging ensembling strategy. The final predicted score ˆ𝑠
is computed as: ˆ𝑠=𝑠1+𝑠2+𝑠3
3.
Mapping Score to Target Scale. The predicted score ˆ𝑠is initially on a 0–100 scale. However, human-
annotated scores in different datasets may use different scales (e.g., 1–5). To ensure compatibility
with the evaluation criteria, we apply a linear transformation [ 5]. For example, for datasets where
the human-annotated scores follow a 1–5 scale, we map the predicted score as follows: E(𝑥,𝑦, 𝑟)=
ˆ𝑠
100×4+1. This transformation ensures that the predicted scores align with the target scale of each
dataset, andE(𝑥,𝑦, 𝑟)is the final correctness score produced by our SWE-Judge.
4 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
In this section, we introduce the datasets used in our experiments, the baseline methods for
comparison, and the evaluation methodology to assess the effectiveness of our proposed metric.
We also outline the implementation details and define the key research questions.
4.1 Datasets
We evaluate SWE-Judge on three popular SE tasks: code generation, automated program repair,
and code summarization. The primary goal is to assess how well SWE-Judge’s results align with
human evaluation results. Therefore, we have selected evaluation datasets that include human
evaluation scores. The selected datasets are:
•CoNaLa [36] is a Python Code Generation benchmark consisting of 472 tasks sourced from
StackOverflow. We selected CoNaLa because Evtikhiev et al.[ 11] provided human evaluation
scores for code generated by various automated code generation tools addressing these CoNaLa
coding problems. Specifically, experienced software developers rated the generated code on a
scale from 0–4.
•Card2Code Hearthstone (shortened as Card2Code) [ 19] is a Python Code Generation benchmark
derived from the collectible trading card game Hearthstone. The dataset contains 665 pairs, each
consisting of a Hearthstone card description and its corresponding Python code snippet. We

evaluators rated the generated code on a scale from 0–4.
•APR-Assess [15] is a human-annotated dataset for Automated Program Repair (APR) , involving
the generation of patches (i.e., code changes) to fix identified bugs. It consists of 189 patches gen-
erated by program repair tools, each manually evaluated for correctness. Experienced developers
rated the quality of these patches on a scale from 0–1.

•Summary-Assess [29] is a human-annotated dataset for Code Summarization , which focuses on
generating accurate descriptions for given code snippets. It consists of 1,611 code summaries
annotated by 226 human developers and is based on a publicly available Java code summarization
dataset[ 17]. Human annotators evaluate various aspects of each summary, including conciseness,
fluency, and content adequacy, on a scale from 1 to 5. Since our study focuses on the correctness
aspect, we use the human evaluation results specifically for content adequacy as the ground
truth labels.
In addition to evaluating the alignment with human assessment results, we also examine how
well SWE-Judge aligns with test case execution outcomes. To this end, we select two popular code
generation datasets with available test cases: HumanEval-X [ 40], which spans multiple programming
languages, and APPS [14], which includes more complex and challenging coding tasks.
•HumanEval-X [40] is a multilingual extension of the widely used code generation benchmark
HumanEval [ 2]. It consists of 164 introductory coding tasks, each with a natural language
description, test cases, and a reference solution. For our evaluation, we focus on five programming
languages: Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Go.
•APPS [14] is a Python code generation benchmark that includes introductory-level, interview-
level, and competition-level coding tasks collected from code competition websites. We evaluate
SWE-Judge on 100 sampled competition-level tasks of APPS.
4.2 Selected Baselines
Match-based Metrics. We choose 7 popular match-based metrics as baselines. BLEU [25] measures
the similarity between the generated content and the ground-truth answer by comparing n-gram
overlaps while applying a penalty for excessively short responses. ROUGE-L [18] measures the simi-
larity by using the longest common subsequence between the generated code/text and the reference
code/text. METEOR [1] measures the similarity based on the number of matched tokens. ChrF++ [26]
measures the similarity by character-level n-gram precision and recall. CodeBLEU [28] enhances
traditional BLEU by incorporating structural code similarities. RUBY [32] evaluates similarity by
considering lexical, syntactical, and semantic representations of source code. CrystalBLEU [10] is
the state-of-the-art match-based metric designed to measure code similarity. It first removes the
most common n-grams before calculating the BLEU score to better capture meaningful differences
between the generated content and the ground truth answer.
Embedding-based Metric. We choose 4 popular embedding-based metrics as baselines. Mover-
Score [39] evaluates similarity by computing the Earth Mover’s Distance between the generated con-
tent and the reference answer. It represents both code/texts using token embeddings. BERTScore [38]
calculates pairwise token similarity between the generated content and the reference answer with
token representations from a pre-trained model BERT. CodeBERTScore [42] is a state-of-the-art
embedding-based metric designed for code evaluation, building upon BERTScore with adaptations
for code-specific tasks. It leverages a fine-tuned CodeBERT model [ 12] to encode both the gen-
erated and reference code, then calculates a cosine similarity matrix between their embeddings
to assess semantic alignment. Lastly, for the code summarization task specifically, SIDE [22] is a
state-of-the-art metric that leverages contrastive learning when calculating cosine similarity.
LLM-as-judge Metrics. We select two LLM-as-judge metrics as baselines. Vanilla LLM refers to
the default LLM used with a straightforward prompt, without employing the specialized strategies
proposed in this work. Specifically, we provide the LLM with a simple instruction:“Please assign
a correctness score to the given input data.” ICE-Score [45] is the state-of-the-art LLM-as-judge
method for code evaluation. It extends the recent LLM-as-judge approach for text, G-Eval [ 20],
, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: May 2025.An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks 11
with adaptations for code evaluation. ICE-Score prompts the LLM to generate a correctness score
based on pre-defined evaluation criteria.
4.3 Effectiveness Evaluation
We use two evaluation approaches to assess the effectiveness of SWE-Judge and baselines.
Statistical Correlations. Prior studies [ 11,45] have employed statistical correlation metrics,
such as Kendall’s 𝜏coefficient ,Spearman’s 𝑟𝑠, and Pearson’s 𝑟𝑝, as robust methods to measure the
statistical correlation between evaluation results produced by automatic evaluation metrics and
the ground truth. Specifically, Kendall’s 𝜏coefficient [ 4] measures the ordinal association between
two data, Spearman 𝑟𝑠[8] is a measure of rank correlation, and Pearson’s 𝑟𝑝[6] is a measure of
linear correlation. In this work, we adopt those three correlation scores to evaluate SWE-Judge
on all studied tasks and datasets. For ease of comparing different methods, we also calculate the
averaged correlation score by averaging the three kinds of correlations above.
Statistical Agreements. We also evaluate the statistical agreement between our tool’s results and
human evaluation scores. Specifically, we use Cohen’s Kappa score [3], a statistical measure that
assesses the agreement between two raters who independently classify items into categories.
4.4 Implementation Details
We evaluate the effectiveness of SWE-Judge using the OpenAI GPT-4o mini model (i.e., gpt-4o-
mini-2024-07-18 ) [23] as the backbone. We selected the GPT-4o mini model due to its lightweight,
fast, and cost-effective nature, providing a more affordable alternative compared to the OpenAI
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, o1, o3, and GPT-4.5 models [ 24]. We set the temperature to 0 to reduce
the impact of randomness in the LLM on the results.
4.5 Research Questions
Our work aims to mainly answer three Research Questions (RQs).
•RQ1: How well does SWE-Judge correlate with human judgment compared to baseline
methods? In RQ1, we investigate whether SWE-Judge generates evaluation results that more
closely correlate with human judgment compared to baseline evaluation metrics.
•RQ2: How does the agreement between SWE-Judge and human evaluators compare to
the agreement among humans? In RQ2, we quantify the gap between human-tool agreement
and human-human agreement to assess how closely SWE-Judge can replace human evaluators.
•RQ3: How do the key design components of SWE-Judge impact its effectiveness? We
conduct an ablation study to assess the contributions of the main modules within SWE-Judge.
5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we present experimental results and answers to each research question.
5.1 RQ1: Correlation with Human Scores
In this RQ, we evaluate the correlation between SWE-Judge ’s scores and human-annotated scores.
Table 1 shows how well SWE-Judge ’s scores correlate with human judgments across four human-
annotated datasets. For the results of each dataset, the first three columns report statistical correla-
tion metrics: Kendall’s 𝜏, Spearman’s 𝑟𝑠, and Pearson’s 𝑟𝑝, respectively.
SWE-Judge achieves the highest alignment with human evaluations, consistently and
significantly outperforming all baseline methods. As shown in Table 1, on the CoNaLa dataset,
SWE-Judge surpasses all baselines by 27.1%–159.1%, based on the average of three statistical
correlation metrics. On the Card2Code dataset, it demonstrates gains between 5.9% and 63.8%, while

on APR-Asses, improvements exceed 70.7%. For the Summary-Assess dataset, SWE-Judge again
leads with gains from 15.8% to 183.8% on average. Furthermore, SWE-Judge shows generalizability
across diverse software artifacts: code changes in APR-Assess, code snippets in CoNaLa and
Card2Code, and natural language descriptions in Summary-Assess. In all cases, SWE-Judge achieves
the highest correlation with human scores, consistently outperforming all the others
SWE-Judge achieves strong alignment with human judgments on code generation and
automated program repair datasets. For code generation, SWE-Judge achieves high correlations
on the CoNaLa dataset, with Kendall’s 𝜏= 60.3, Spearman’s 𝑟𝑝= 71.2, and Pearson’s 𝑟𝑠= 68.3. On
the Card2Code code generation dataset, the scores are even higher: Kendall’s 𝜏= 70.4, Spearman’s
𝑟𝑝= 83.8, and Pearson’s 𝑟𝑠= 81.7. For automated program repair, SWE-Judge demonstrates even
stronger alignment on the APR-Assess dataset, reaching 77.5 across all three metrics. Although
SWE-Judge ’s performance on the code summarization dataset (Summary-Assess) is relatively
lower compared to other datasets, it still significantly outperforms competing methods.
Answer to RQ1 :SWE-Judge achieves the highest alignment with human evaluations,
consistently and significantly outperforming all baseline methods by 5.9%–183.8% across
four human-annotated datasets. These datasets cover three popular SE tasks, namely code
generation, automated program repair, and code summarization, and include three distinct
types of software artifacts.
5.2 RQ2: Human-Tool Agreement V.S. Human-Human Agreement
In RQ2, we evaluate how closely SWE-Judge aligns with individual human annotators compared to
how well humans agree with each other.
Setup. It is important to note that the datasets we study, i.e., CoNaLa, Card2Code, APR-Assess, and
Summary-Assess, are all annotated by multiple human developers. In RQ1, we used the aggregated

between SWE-Judge and humans (highlighted in blue).
human score as the ground truth. This score is obtained by combining the individual ratings
from different annotators. For example, in the CoNaLa dataset, Evtikhiev et al. [ 11] adopted the
M-MSR algorithm [ 21] to aggregate multiple human grades into a single aggregated human score.
In contrast, RQ2 uses individual human annotations as the ground truth to evaluate SWE-Judge . Our
objective is to measure the gap between the agreement levels of SWE-Judge with human annotators
(human-tool agreement) and the agreement among human annotators themselves (human-human
agreement). If its agreement with individual annotators matches the level of agreement among
humans themselves, it indicates that SWE-Judge could serve as a reliable surrogate for human
evaluation.
Specifically, we group human annotators into pairs and compute Cohen’s Kappa [ 3] scores to
quantify their agreement levels. For each dataset, we report:
•Min Human–Human: the lowest agreement score observed among all human annotator pairs;
•Max Human–Human: the highest agreement score observed among all annotator pairs;
•Average Human–Human: the mean agreement across all annotator pairs.
Additionally, we pair SWE-Judge with each human annotator and compute the average Cohen’s
Kappa score on all human-tool pairs, denoted as Average Human–Tool. This metric reflects the
overall agreement between SWE-Judge and individual human annotators. In Figure 4, we highlight
the Average Human–Tool score in red for visual clarity.
Results. Figure 4 presents the comparison between human–tool and human–human agreement
across the four human-annotated datasets.
SWE-Judge achieves agreement levels with human annotators that, on average, are
comparable to the agreement observed among human annotators themselves on the code
, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: May 2025.14 Xin Zhou, Kisub Kim, Ting Zhang, Martin Weyssow, Luís F. Gomes, Guang Yang, and David Lo
generation and automated program repair tasks. For code generation, SWE-Judge achieves an
average Cohen’s Kappa score of 24.1 on the CoNaLa dataset, slightly below the human–human
average of 25.7. On the Card2Code dataset, SWE-Judge performs even better, with a score of
35.1 compared to the human–human average of 30.5. For automated program repair, SWE-Judge
attains a Cohen’s Kappa score of 66.7, surpassing the human–human agreement average of 60.1.
These results suggest that SWE-Judge has the potential to serve as a reliable substitute for human
evaluators in evaluating both code generation and automated program repair tasks.
However, in the code summarization task, there remains a substantial gap between the
agreement of SWE-Judge and human annotators compared to human–human agreement.
On the Summary-Assess dataset, SWE-Judge achieves an average Cohen’s Kappa score of 4.6, which
is significantly lower than the human–human average of 15.5. This suggests that SWE-Judge is not
yet a viable replacement for human evaluators in the context of code summarization. Nonetheless,
as shown in Table 1, SWE-Judge remains the best-performing automatic evaluation metric in the
code summarization task, highlighting the progress made through our approach.
Answer to RQ2 : On average, SWE-Judge achieves agreement levels with human annotators
that are comparable to those observed among human annotators themselves in code gener-
ation and automated program repair tasks. This suggests that SWE-Judge can be reliably
used as a substitute for human evaluators in these tasks. However, a gap remains in using
SWE-Judge to replace human evaluators in the code summarization task.
5.3 RQ3: Ablation Study
In this RQ, we examine the contribution of two key components in SWE-Judge : 1) the Strategy
Design, and 2) the Dynamic Team Selection. Table 1 presents the results of the ablation study in the
last two rows. The row labeled as “wo Team Selection” shows the performance of SWE-Judge without
the team selection mechanism, where all strategies are combined through simple ensembling. The
row labeled “wo Team & Strategy” presents SWE-Judge ’s performance when both the team selection
mechanism and custom-designed strategies are removed, relying solely on an LLM with a basic
prompt: “Please assign a correctness score to the given input data.”
All key designs are essential for achieving the best effectiveness. Based on the results
shown in Table 1, we observe that removing any key design in SWE-Judge leads to a reduction in
statistical correlation scores. Specifically, without the team selection mechanism, the variant of
SWE-Judge shows drops of 5.4%, 21.3%, and 14.9% in the average correlation scores for CoLaNa,
APR-assess, and Summary-assess, respectively. While the lack of team selection does not negatively
impact performance on the Card2Code dataset, the overall average performance across all four
datasets decreases by 9.6%. Furthermore, removing both the team selection mechanism and the
custom-designed strategies leads to drops of 46.4%, 7.1%, 52.8%, and 13.6% in the average correlation
scores for CoLaNa, Card2Code, APR-assess, and Summary-assess, respectively. These results
underscore the critical role of each component in SWE-Judge’s effectiveness.
Answer to RQ3 : The key designs are essential for the effectiveness of SWE-Judge. Removing
these designs results in performance drops of 46.4%, 7.1%, 52.8%, and 13.6% in the average
correlation scores for CoLaNa, Card2Code, APR-assess, and Summary-assess, respectively.

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Generalizability to Test Case Execution Outcomes
In this subsection, we examine the generalizability of SWE-Judge to labels based on test execution,
evaluating how well SWE-Judge’s scores align with the execution outcomes, where 0 indicates test
failure while 1 represents test success. To this end, we select two popular code generation datasets
that include accompanying test cases: HumanEval-X [ 40], which spans multiple programming
languages, and APPS [ 14], which provides more complex and challenging coding tasks. Table 2
presents the average correlation between SWE-Judge ’s evaluation scores and test case execution
results on both datasets.
Table 2 demonstrates that SWE-Judge achieves the highest average correlation with test case
execution outcomes, consistently and significantly outperforming all baseline methods. On the
HumanEval-X dataset, SWE-Judge outperforms all baselines by an average margin of 32.1% to
78.8% across all programming languages. On the APPS dataset, SWE-Judge achieves even greater
improvements, surpassing all baselines by 175.6% to 1691.7% in terms of average correlation scores.
These results confirm SWE-Judge ’s generalizability from human-annotated scores to test case-based
execution outcomes.
6.2 Case Study
Figure 5 presents selected examples of generated software artifacts, along with their corresponding
scores from top-performing automatic evaluation metrics and human annotators. The figure
includes evaluations of generated code from the CoNaLa dataset and code summaries from the
Summary-Assess dataset. Those human scores range from 0 (incorrect) to 4 (fully correct). From
these examples, we identify three main issues with existing metrics. First, BERTScore, MoverScore,
and CodeBERTScore tend to assign high scores across most examples, while ChrF++ and CodeBLEU
tend to give relatively low scores. This reduces score variation and makes it harder to distinguish
correct data from incorrect ones, potentially misleading the users. Second, except for ICE-Score
and the Vanilla LLM method, the other baselines fail to produce scores that fall within the same
range as human annotations, which makes direct comparison challenging. Third, some baselines
mistakenly assign higher or equal scores to incorrect data compared to correct ones. For example,

all give higher or equal scores to flawed code. In contrast, SWE-Judge does not suffer from those
issues. Its scores are more consistent with human judgments and better reflect the correctness of
the data under evaluation.
6.3 Threats to Validity
Our findings are limited to the specific SE datasets examined in this study and may not generalize
to all SE datasets. To mitigate this limitation, we selected three widely adopted datasets—CoNaLa,
Card2Code, and Summary-Assess—and introduced APR-Assess, a human-annotated dataset not
previously studied in this context. These benchmarks collectively span three major SE tasks: code
generation, automated program repair, and code summarization. They also cover diverse software
artifacts, including source code, code changes, and code comments. Moreover, SWE-Judge uses the
OpenAI GPT-4o mini model for its cost-effectiveness, though its performance may improve when
more advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.5) are used. Users may choose a more advanced and inevitably
more expensive LLM if they aim to achieve even higher performance.
7 RELATED WORK
Evaluating the correctness of software artifacts generated by automated tools remains a major
challenge. While human evaluation is accurate, it is labor-intensive and not scalable. Test-based
, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: May 2025.An LLM-as-Judge Metric for Bridging the Gap with Human Evaluation in SE Tasks 17
metrics like pass@k [ 2] require manually written test cases, making them also impractical for
large-scale use. To address this, many automatic evaluation metrics have been adopted in SE
tasks. Several are adapted from natural language processing (NLP), such as BLEU [ 25], ROUGE-
L [18], METEOR [ 1], ChrF++ [ 26], and BERTScore [ 38]. Beyond these, SE-specific metrics have been
proposed to better capture the characteristics of SE data. Ren et al. introduced CodeBLEU [ 28], which
extends BLEU by incorporating code syntax and structure. Tran et al. proposed RUBY [ 32], which
measures similarity using lexical, syntactic, and semantic representations. Eghbali et al. developed
CrystalBLEU [ 10], which improves BLEU by filtering out common n-grams to focus on more
informative patterns. Zhou et al. proposed CodeBERTScore [ 42], which adapts BERTScore to code
by leveraging a fine-tuned CodeBERT model to compute semantic similarity between generated and
reference code. Mastropaolo et al. introduced SIDE [ 22], a metric that applies contrastive learning
to enhance cosine similarity-based evaluation on code summaries. Recently, Zhuo et al. proposed
ICE-Score[ 45], which prompts an LLM to assign a correctness score (0–4) based on predefined
criteria, enabling more accurate evaluation aligned with human judgment. Additionally, Evtikhiev
et al. [ 11] empirically evaluated six metrics—BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, ChrF, CodeBLEU, and
RUBY—against human judgments and found significant misalignment, emphasizing the need for
more accurate and reliable automatic metrics.
In contrast to existing SE-specific metrics, SWE-Judge (1) leverages LLMs to better capture the
semantics of software artifacts, (2) introduces diverse evaluation strategies to infer correctness, and
(3) incorporates a lightweight team selection process to identify effective strategy combinations,
thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of automatic correctness evaluation. Moreover,
while prior metrics are typically evaluated on a single SE task (e.g., code generation), our study
demonstrates the effectiveness of SWE-Judge across three popular tasks: code generation, automated
program repair, and code summarization.
Additionally, several concurrent studies investigate similar topics in parallel. Wang et al. [ 33]
empirically investigate LLM-as-a-judge methods from NLP for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on
consistency and readability aspects. In contrast, our study introduces a new SE-specific metric
that accurately reflects the functional correctness of generated software artifacts. Tong et al. [ 31]
proposed CODEJUDGE, which uses LLMs to evaluate the functional correctness of generated code
in code generation. Dong et al. [ 9] proposed CodeScore, a method that estimates the functional
correctness of generated code by evaluating its pass ratio and executability. Unlike their approaches,
we propose a team selection mechanism and diverse prompting strategies to infer functional
correctness, while also evaluating our tool across three popular tasks. CodeUltraFeedback [ 34]
assesses LLMs’ alignment with human evaluations from five non-functional code aspects, such
as coding style. In contrast, our study focuses on proposing a new, effective SE-specific metric to
evaluate the functional correctness of software artifacts.
8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we present SWE-Judge, the first LLM-as-Ensemble-Judge metric specifically designed
to evaluate the correctness of generated software artifacts. SWE-Judge employs a multi-evaluator
framework to ensure accurate and reliable evaluations. It defines five distinct evaluation strategies
and introduces a dynamic team selection mechanism that chooses the most appropriate subset of
strategies. Our experiments show that SWE-Judge achieves significantly and consistently higher cor-
relations with human judgments—ranging from 5.9% to 183.8% improvement on average, compared
to existing automated evaluation metrics. Furthermore, SWE-Judge reaches agreement levels with
human annotators that are comparable to inter-annotator agreement in tasks like code generation
and automated program repair.

In future work, we plan to extend SWE-Judge beyond correctness evaluation to cover additional
dimensions, such as assessing non-functional properties of generated software artifacts.
