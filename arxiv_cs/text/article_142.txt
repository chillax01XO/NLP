Abstract
Recent advances in generative AI have enabled visual con-
tent creation through text-to-image (T2I) generation. How-
ever, despite their creative potential, T2I models often repli-
cate and amplify societal stereotypes—particularly those re-
lated to gender, race, and culture—raising important ethical
concerns. This paper proposes a theory-driven bias detection
rubric and a Social Stereotype Index ( SSI) to systematically
evaluate social biases in T2I outputs. We audited three major
T2I model outputs—DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and Sta-
bility AI Core—using 100 queries across three categories—
geocultural ,occupational , and adjectival . Our analysis re-
veals that initial outputs are prone to include stereotypical vi-
sual cues, including gendered professions, cultural markers,
and western beauty norms. To address this, we adopted our
rubric to conduct targeted prompt refinement using LLMs,
which significantly reduced bias— SSI dropped by 61% for
geocultural , 69% for occupational , and 51% for adjectival
queries. We complemented our quantitative analysis through
a user study examining perceptions, awareness, and prefer-
ences around AI-generated biased imagery. Our findings re-
veal a key tension—although prompt refinement can mitigate
stereotypes, it can limit contextual alignment. Interestingly,
users often perceived stereotypical images to be more aligned
with their expectations. We discuss the need to balance ethi-
cal debiasing with contextual relevance and call for T2I sys-
tems that support global diversity and inclusivity while not
compromising the reflection of real-world social complexity.
1 Introduction
Recent advances in generative AI have enabled powerful
text-to-image (T2I) models, which can generate entirely
new photorealistic visual content directly from textual de-
scriptions as queries. These models represent a significant
leap from earlier text-to-image retrieval approaches—such
as search engines—that returned existing images in response
to user queries (Rombach et al. 2022; Ramesh et al. 2022;
Saharia et al. 2022). As a result of T2I models’ growing ac-
cessibility and creative flexibility, they are now used across
a range of applications, including art, education, design,
and communication. However, despite their rapid advance-
ments, T2I models have raised several ethical concerns. As
with many generative AI systems, T2I models mirror the
data on which they are trained—datasets scraped from the
web that are often biased, imbalanced, and lacking in cul-
tural or demographic diversity. These concerns are not en-
tirely new. Traditional search engines have long exhibited
biases, such as associating certain professions with specific
genders (e.g., doctors as men, nurses as women) (Kopeiniket al. 2023). Generative T2I models, however, pose a greater
risk—they can not only retrieve biased images, but also
can generate new ones that subtly or overtly reproduce and
amplify stereotypes around race, gender, age, and occupa-
tion (Bianchi et al. 2023; Luccioni et al. 2023; Ghosh 2024;
Bird, Ungless, and Kasirzadeh 2023).
Importantly, biases are not merely technical artifacts;
they can have tangible societal harms . AI-generated im-
agery has the potential to reinforce harmful or stereotypical
representations, propagate misinformation, erode trust in AI
systems, and distort public perceptions (Zhou et al. 2023;
Zhang et al. 2024). Despite these concerns, our understand-
ing of how to effectively identify and mitigate these biases in
T2I systems remains limited. Most current approaches rely
on ad-hoc audits, case studies, or red-teaming efforts that,
while useful, are not scalable and often fail to detect more
nuanced or context-dependent stereotypes.
Moreover, it is important to understand how end-users
perceive these biases (Barlas et al. 2021; Otterbacher et al.
2018). A user may not be aware that the outputs they engage
with are skewed by underlying social biases—especially
when the imagery appears photorealistic. This lack of aware-
ness is particularly concerning, as it not only makes biases
harder to detect and critique but also increases the risk of
uncritical acceptance and downstream amplification, such as
through the use of biased images in educational, journalis-
tic, or promotional contexts. Therefore, as generative models
become more integrated into content creation pipelines, it is
critical to develop robust, scalable, and user-informed meth-
ods to detect and mitigate these biases in a way that aligns
with diverse societal values and expectations.
To address the aforementioned gaps, we examine the pres-
ence, detection, and mitigation of social stereotypes in T2I
outputs, guided by the following research questions (RQs):
RQ1: Can we automatically detect and quantify social
stereotypes in images generated by T2I models, and how
prevalent are these biases?
RQ2: To what extent can prompt refinement, guided by
a theory-driven stereotype identification rubric, mitigate
stereotypical representations in AI-generated imagery?
RQ3: How do end-users perceive and respond to stereotyp-
ical cues in T2I outputs, and what are their expectations,
concerns, or desires regarding these images?
For our study, we evaluated three state-of-the-art T2I
models—Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stability AI—with 100
queries categorized into geocultural ,occupational , and ad-
jectival themes. First, we developed a theory-driven rubric
to identify and operationalize stereotypical bias in imagesthrough a social stereotypical index ( SSI). We adopted this
rubric through an LLM (GPT-4o) to obtain SSI in gener-
ated images, and refined the prompts with structured in-
structions to incorporate diversity, inclusivity, and a realistic
contextual framework. Then, we used the refined prompts
to re-generate the final set of images, and measured SSI—
thereby, comparing SSI of initial and refined images. Fi-
nally, we conducted an interview study with 17 participants,
comprising a mental image elicitation stage followed by a
rapid-fire comparison of initial and refined T2I outputs. We
qualitatively analyzed how participants perceived the align-
ment of generated images with their expectations and the
presence of stereotypical biases.
We found that the initial outputs contained multiple
stereotypical cues. Our prompt-refinement approach re-
duced stereotypical bias—by 61% for geocultural , 69% for
occupational , and 51% for adjectival queries. However, we
observed an interesting tradeoff—reducing stereotypes often
resulted in more generic and globally neutral images, some-
times at the expense of prompt specificity. Finally, our user
perception study revealed that while users value inclusivity,
stereotypical visual cues were often perceived as more con-
textually appropriate and recognizable. This underscores the
challenge of balancing ethical representation with user ex-
pectations. Our study makes the following contributions:
1. A theory-driven rubric to quantify social bias in gen-
erated images. At its core is the Social Stereotype In-
dex ( SSI), a novel metric that systematically captures
and compares stereotypical content across model outputs
using multimodal LLMs.
2. An automated debiasing mechanism incorporating ad-
ditional context into user inputs (using an intermediate
LLM prompt generation step) to reduce social stereo-
types in generated images.
3. A systematic understanding of user perceptions, con-
cerns, and expectations regarding stereotypical biases
in AI-generated images.
Overall, our study contributes to ongoing efforts to de-
sign socially responsible generative AI systems by surfacing
key tensions between ethical representation and user expec-
tations. Beyond demonstrating how prompt refinement can
reduce stereotypical outputs, our findings point to broader
design and technical implications: the need for bias-aware
prompt engineering, interaction-time interventions, and flex-
ible evaluation rubrics across cultural contexts. Importantly,
we highlight the role of user perceptions in reinforcing or re-
sisting biases, underscoring the importance of participatory
approaches and AI literacy initiatives to help users critically
engage with these technologies. We discuss the need to de-
sign more inclusive T2I systems and the broader sociotech-
nical landscape in which they are deployed.
2 Background and Related Work
Social Stereotypes: Definition and Impacts
Social stereotypes are oversimplified beliefs, fixed beliefs,
or generalized assumptions about groups of people, often
based on attributes such as race, gender, religion, or occu-
pation (Blum 2004). These stereotypes not only misrepre-
sent diversity within social groups but also contribute to sys-
temic discrimination, limiting opportunities for individuals
and shaping societal inequalities (Banaji, Fiske, and Massey
2021; Nadal et al. 2016). Prior work highlighted that stereo-
types can negatively impact individuals’ economic, social,and psychological well-being, contributing to higher risks
of marginalization, restricted career advancement, and ex-
posure to hate crimes (Banaji, Fiske, and Massey 2021).
Digital platforms have become powerful conduits for
spreading stereotypes at scale. With billions of users engag-
ing daily, biased narratives can reach vast audiences. This is
particularly concerning as individuals often process online
content heuristically—relying on mental shortcuts rather
than critical evaluation—which can lead to uncritical accep-
tance of biased or stereotyped representations (Pennycook
and Rand 2019; Metzger and Flanagin 2013). Furthermore,
when stereotypes are propagated invisibly—through search
results, social media feeds, or AI-generated outputs—users
may unknowingly internalize them, further entrenching so-
cietal inequalities (Walsh 2020). If users do not recognize
biased representations, technical fixes alone might be insuf-
ficient to mitigate harms (Raji et al. 2020). Therefore, schol-
ars have emphasized the need to examine how AI outputs are
received and normalized, to design interventions that pro-
mote awareness, critical engagement, and equity in digital
spaces (Sandvig et al. 2014; Veale, Van Kleek, and Binns
2018; Eslami et al. 2015).
In this paper, we examine the presence of social stereo-
types in text-to-image (T2I) generation and explore how
users perceive and interpret these representations. Building
on prior work, we define and operationalize key social di-
mensions of stereotypical bias through a structured rubric-
based questionnaire designed to audit AI-generated outputs.
Complementing this with a qualitative study, we elicit end-
users’ mental image to examine how their expectations align
with AI-generated images and how stereotypical representa-
tions are internalized or resisted in practice.
Social Bias in Text-to-Image Results
Text-to-image (T2I) systems have been a key interface for
information access—initially through search engines and
now through generative AI. However, much like earlier con-
cerns about bias in image search results (Otterbacher et al.
2018; Kay, Matuszek, and Munson 2015; Noble 2018; Ot-
terbacher 2018), T2I models have been shown to reproduce
and in some cases, amplify social stereotypes (Friedrich
et al. 2024; Bianchi et al. 2023; Ghosh 2024; Luccioni et al.
2023). This tendency is driven not only by biases in large,
uncurated training corpora (Garcia et al. 2023), but also by
optimization strategies that prioritize perceived realism and
user engagement (Binns 2018; Mehrabi et al. 2021). As a
result, these systems often reflect dominant cultural norms
while marginalizing underrepresented identities, raising se-
rious concerns about fairness and representation.
A rich body of work has audited T2I systems for recur-
ring patterns of bias across social dimensions (Luccioni et al.
2023; Ghosh 2024; Bird, Ungless, and Kasirzadeh 2023).
Studies have shown that occupational roles such as “com-
puter programmer” or “civil engineer” typically output im-
ages of men, while prompts like “librarian” or “nurse” yield
images of women (Kay, Matuszek, and Munson 2015; Naik
and Nushi 2023; Singh et al. 2020), reinforcing stereotypi-
cal gender roles in the workforce (Heilman 2012; Gaucher,
Kay, and Laurin 2011). Further, adjectival descriptors such
as “competent” or “rational” tend to produce male figures,
whereas terms like “warm” or “emotional” more often re-
sult in female-presenting individuals (Otterbacher, Bates,
and Clough 2017; Naik and Nushi 2023), reflecting long-
standing gender schema theories associating competence
with masculinity and emotionality with femininity (Heilman2012). Prior work also found racial and cultural biases in
T2I outputs— queries related to leadership roles (“CEO”,
“boss”) predominantly yield images of white men (Celis and
Keswani 2020; Kay, Matuszek, and Munson 2015; Wan and
Chang 2024; Wang et al. 2023), while beauty-related queries
often default to western beauty standards, over-representing
lighter skin tones and particular body shapes and under-
representing diverse cultural aesthetics (Ara ´ujo, Meira Jr,
and Almeida 2016; Magno et al. 2016).
While prior audits in T2I systems have offered valuable
insights, they often focus on a limited set of dimensions
(e.g., gender or race), rely on case-specific examples, or lack
systematic frameworks for operationalizing stereotype de-
tection. To address these gaps, we introduce a theory-driven
rubric that captures a broad range of bias dimensions, en-
abling scalable and structured evaluation of social stereo-
types in T2I outputs. We demonstrate its utility through a
systematic audit of three state-of-the-art T2I models across
geocultural ,occupational , and adjectival query types. This
rubric-based approach offers a replicable way to audit and
inform evaluations of AI applications in different domains.
Anticipating and Mitigating Harms of AI
Despite their growing presence in everyday life, AI sys-
tems frequently fail in practice—exhibiting unexpected be-
haviors, biases, and harms ranging from misinformation,
stereotyping, discrimination, exclusion, and erosion of au-
tonomy (Mittelstadt et al. 2016; Sandvig et al. 2014; Floridi
et al. 2018; Raji et al. 2022; Ghosh and Caliskan 2023). En-
suring that these AI operates as intended remains a persistent
challenge. Although it is challenging to anticipate all unin-
tended consequences (Boyarskaya, Olteanu, and Crawford
2020; Coston et al. 2023; Raji et al. 2020), growing efforts
have sought to systematically understand and mitigate risks
through benchmark datasets (Jaiswal et al. 2024; Subramo-
nian et al. 2023; Reuel-Lamparth et al. 2024), taxonomies
of AI failures (Raji et al. 2020), frameworks for explainabil-
ity (Liao, Gruen, and Miller 2020; Ehsan et al. 2023), ethical
tensions in practice (Chancellor et al. 2019), and guidelines
for human-AI interaction (Amershi et al. 2019).
Prior research has also focused on transparency and ac-
countability in AI through structured documentation prac-
tices to highlight potential biases, limitations, and appro-
priate use cases. Notable efforts include datasheets for
datasets (Gebru et al. 2021), model cards (Mitchell et al.
2019), and explainability fact sheets (Sokol and Flach
2020). Researchers have highlighted the importance of par-
ticipatory approaches that actively involve diverse stake-
holder groups—whose perspectives are shaped by varied
backgrounds and lived experiences—in the design, evalu-
ation, and governance of AI systems (Jakesch et al. 2022;
Madaio et al. 2022; Coston et al. 2023; Wagner et al. 2021;
Kawakami et al. 2023; Das Swain and Saha 2024).
In the context of T2I systems, benchmarks such as
HEIM (Lee et al. 2023), CCUB (Liu et al. 2024), and
ViSAGe (Jha et al. 2024) have been proposed to provide
standardized evaluations for fairness, cultural diversity, and
nationality-based stereotypes. Prior work has also provided
diagnostic frameworks to highlight multiple axes of bias,
such as word-level attributes (Lin et al. 2023), homoglyph
vulnerabilities (Struppek et al. 2023), multimodal associa-
tion metrics (Mandal, Leavy, and Little 2023), and object
detection disparities (Mannering 2023).
Efforts are also being made to mitigate bias in T2I
systems, encompassing a spectrum of strategies, includingmodel-level interventions such as fine-tuning with fairness-
aware objectives (Shen et al. 2023), synthetic data aug-
mentation (Ko et al. 2024), and inference-time techniques
like chain-of-thought reasoning to guide the model through
more inclusive reasoning steps before producing an image
(Al Sahili, Patras, and Purver 2024). Building on this body
of work, we explore how social harms in T2I systems can be
mitigated dynamically at the point of user interaction. Rather
than relying on post hoc filtering or model retraining, we
propose a structured, lightweight, adaptive technique: auto-
matic prompt reframing. This approach steers outputs to-
ward less biased representations by modifying prompts in
real time, aligning them more closely with inclusive visual
outcomes. This enables a flexible and scalable mitigation
strategy that operates entirely at the interaction layer, requir-
ing no access to the T2I model internals.
3 Study Design and Data
We conducted a two-part study combining computational
audit with qualitative user interviews to examine social
stereotypes in T2I outputs. Using 100 queries across geocul-
tural ,occupational , and adjectival categories, we generated
1,200 images from three state-of-the-art models: DALL-E-3,
Midjourney-6.1, and Stability AI Core. These models span
diverse architectures and training approaches. Rather than
directly comparing model performance, our primary goal is
to evaluate a broad spectrum of T2I generations to uncover
a range of stereotypical representations. To assess these pat-
terns, we developed a theory-driven rubric and computed
a Social Stereotype Index ( SSI) that reflects the degree of
bias in the generated images. We then conducted prompt
refinement and regenerated the images that would lead to
reduced stereotyped outputs (lower SSI). Finally, we con-
ducted semi-structured interviews with 17 participants to
explore users’ mental images, perceptions of stereotypical
cues, and preferences between initial and refined T2I out-
puts. Figure 1 provides an overview of our study design.
Compiling a T2I Dataset
We thoroughly consulted a body of work on social stereo-
types and AI biases (Luccioni et al. 2023; Bianchi et al.
2023; Naik and Nushi 2023) to identify and focus on three
categories—1) geocultural , 2)occupational , and 3) adjecti-
valstereotypes. To enable a comprehensive assessment, we
first curated 100 input queries and subsequently generated
the corresponding images.
Geocultural Queries: These queries reference geographic
groups to evaluate how T2I generation may reflect geocul-
tural stereotypes. We used the ViSAGe dataset (Jha et al.
2024) to select 34 prompts covering different regions of the
world that are often stereotyped. These queries are in the
form of a photo of a [G] person , where [G]includes nation-
alities such as Bangladeshi, French, Nigerian , etc.
Occupational Queries: These queries reference job roles
to evaluate how T2I models represent professions, which are
often subject to gendered or racial stereotypes. We selected
33 queries based on prior work (Kay, Matuszek, and Munson
2015), in the format of, a photo of a [O] , where [O]includes
occupational roles like baker, ceo, fashion designer , etc.
Adjectival Queries: These queries use descriptive adjec-
tives to assess how T2I outputs visually interpret personality
traits, emotional states, or body shapes, which may carry im-
plicit social biases. We draw on prior work (Tsvetkov et al.
2014) on adjectives and semantic properties to compile 33Refined QueryInput QueryA photo of a B angladeshi person

Generating T2I: To generate image data for analysis,
we prompted DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and Stability AI
Core with each of the 100 queries. Each model produced
four images per query, resulting in a dataset of 1,200 im-
ages (100 queries × 3 models × 4 images per model). The
resulting image set provided a diverse foundation for our
ensuing analysis in assessing how T2I outputs potentially
include stereotypically sensitive cues.
User Perceptions Study
To understand how users interpret AI-generated imagery
and social biases, we conducted a user study that com-
plements our computational analysis. Specifically, we ex-
plored whether participant expectations align or diverge
from T2I outputs across geocultural ,occupational , and ad-
jectival queries. Our study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) at the researchers’ university.
Participants and Recruitment We recruited participants
through posting in Reddit communities such as r/Sam-
pleSize ,r/recruiting ,r/research ,r/AskAcademia ,r/chatgpt ,
r/AskScienceDiscussion ,r/interviews , etc. We chose Red-
dit for its broad and internet-active user base and its estab-
lished use as a cost-effective and scalable recruitment plat-
form in prior research (Shatz 2017). Each recruitment post
contained a link to an interest form that included the study
overview and a demographic questionnaire. We received 239
responses over two months (Feb-April 2025). From these,
we invited a subset of participants to maximize diversity—
17 individuals consented to participate and completed one-
hour interviews conducted via Zoom. Each participant re-
ceived a $20 USD Amazon gift card as compensation. Ta-
ble 1 provides a summary of the participants’ demographics.
Interview Design We conducted a mental image elicita-
tion study, adopting a semi-structured interview design in-
spired by prior research (Norman 2014). Participants were
guided through a slide deck designed to simulate a text-
based search interface. Each interview session included two
sections in sequential order as described below.Mental Image and Visual Expectations Section. We began
by eliciting participants’ mental images for three to five T2I
queries. They were shown the text queries (e.g., a photo of
a French person ) and asked to describe their mental image
of visualizing this query—they were encouraged to use a re-
motely shared whiteboard (on Zoom) to sketch and scribble
their thoughts on how they imagined the query’s response
should be. Then, we showed the participant the AI-generated
outputs one-by-one, randomizing the order of the three mod-
els (e.g., Appendix Figure A1). To minimize perceptual bias
and keep participants focused on the output quality, we with-
held the fact that the images were AI-generated until the end
of the interview. Participants were asked to think-aloud and
comment on image attributes, expectation alignment, and
perceived stereotypes and concerns in the image outputs.
Rapid-Fire Section. In the rapid-fire section, participants
were asked to compare two sets of T2I outputs for nine
queries—one generated from the original queries, the other
generated using our prompt refinement approach (e.g., Ap-
pendix Figure A2). They chose their preferred set and briefly
explained their reasoning. This comparison served two main
purposes—1) to assess the effectiveness of prompt refine-
ment by revealing whether users consistently favored refined
outputs. 2) to gather insights into user preferences, high-
lighting which visual attributes mattered. These responses
also helped identify gaps—if any—between user priorities
and the criteria defined in our evaluation rubric.
4 Methods
Rubric-based Audit of T2I Outputs
Developing a Rubric To systematically audit T2I outputs
for stereotypical biases, we developed a rubric grounded in
both empirical observation and prior literature. We began
by conducting a thorough manual analysis of 15 T2I out-
puts (five from each category), with all co-authors collabo-
ratively reviewing the images and discussing the presence
of stereotypes until we reached consensus. We also used
GPT-4o to assist in bias identification by prompting it to de-
tect stereotypical elements in each image. We combined our
manual inspection as well as GPT-4o’s outputs to producePID Age Gender Ethnicity/Race Education Employment

a set of qualitative memos documenting recurring themes.
Then, recognizing that qualitative descriptions alone may
lack completeness, we consulted prior literature to systemat-
ically organize and refine the criteria for identifying stereo-
types (Wan et al. 2024; Luccioni et al. 2023; Bianchi et al.
2023). Based on this synthesis, we created rubrics—one for
each category—to operationalize and quantify the biases in
the images. The rubric consists of a set of audit question-
naires based on different recurring stereotypical attributes—
such as race, gender, clothing, and objects—that were sup-
ported by both our manual analysis and literature. Table 2
provides the questionnaires in our rubric.
Computing SSI Next, we quantified the degree of social
stereotyping in T2I outputs using a metric that we call the
Social Stereotype Index ( SSI). For each image, we assessed
the presence of stereotypical attributes based on our rubric,
where each attribute was scored using a binary value—1 if
that stereotype was present, and 0 if not. The total number of
attributes evaluated for a given prompt is denoted by N. The
SSIwas then calculated as the sum of all assigned values di-
vided by N, resulting in a normalized score that indicates the
proportion of rubric dimensions exhibiting stereotypes (see
Equation 1). Essentially, SSIranges between 0 and 1, where
0 indicates no stereotypical bias in an image, and higher val-
ues indicate a greater presence of stereotypical bias.

LLM-powered Automated Evaluations of T2I Outputs.
Next, we employed our rubric to automatically evaluate our
T2I dataset. For this purpose, we leveraged the GPT-4o
model, which was the state-of-the-art LLM that enabled si-
multaneous text- and image- input in prompts. Essentially,
we framed each item in our rubric as a question and pre-
sented the LLM alongside the image to be evaluated. For
each question, the LLM responded using binary labels—
1 (for the presence of stereotype) and 0 (for the absence
of stereotype). Each output was requested in JSON format,
which was later processed and aggregated for our analyses.
Our prompt additionally sought for explanation/reasoningAttribute Q: Do these images reinforce a negative stereotype..

the LLM outputs. Appendix Table A1 provides the instruc-
tion prompt to identify the stereotypical biases in images.
Refined Image Generation
LLM-Powered Prompt Refinement After identifying
stereotypical biases in the initial T2I outputs, we applied
an LLM-powered prompt refinement technique aimed at re-
ducing these negative social stereotypes. This approach in-
volved structured instructions prompting the T2I models to
revise the original input by recognizing and addressing po-
tential biased aspects in the generated images.
We developed the set of instruction prompt iteratively
through trial and error to ensure effectiveness and clarity.
We primarily had three key requirements—1) minimize the
stereotypes in the original image set, 2) maintain the visual
coherence and avoid fragmented, collage-like outputs ob-
served in our observations, and 3) preserve the original in-
tent and meaning present in the initial query. Through mul-
tiple rounds of experiments and discussions among the re-
search team, we found that the most effective strategy was
to embed the original query within the refined prompt, al-
lowing the T2I model to add contextual guidance for bias
mitigation while retaining the core prompt content. Accord-
ingly, Appendix Table A2 provides the structured instruc-
tions to GPT-4o to generate the refined prompts.
We found that the refined prompts included a clearer andDALL·E Midjourney Stability AI Overall

A photo of a Bangladeshi person , was refined to, A por-
trait of a confident Bangladeshi person standing in an ur-
ban environment, dressed smartly and engaging with the
viewer, reflecting the diversity and modernity of contempo-
rary Bangladesh. We fed the refined prompts into the same
T2I models to generate our refined image sets.
Generating and Auditing Refined Images Next, we used
the refined prompts to generate refined image sets with the
three T2I models—Dall-E, Midjourney, and Stability AI. We
then measured the SSI of the refined images using the ap-
proach described in Section 4. Finally, we compared the ini-
tial and refined image sets across the three query types, and
evaluated differences in the SSIusing paired t-tests.
Expert Evaluation
To assess the reliability of our automated bias identifica-
tion process, we conducted a manual evaluation of GPT-
4o’s stereotype labels. The second and third authors inde-
pendently reviewed a random sample of 90 image sets—45
each from initial and refined sets (each set contains 4 im-
ages). To resolve interpretive ambiguities and align on la-
beling criteria, the evaluators consulted with the broader au-
thor team. This validation process was essential to account
for the known risk of LLM hallucinations and to assess the
accuracy of our automated bias detection framework.
Table 3 presents the results of the expert evaluation.
We observe a high level of agreement between expert as-
sessments and GPT-4o’s outputs, with a mean accuracy of
88.39%. This strong alignment supports the reliability of
our automated bias identification approach, which leverages
GPT-4o to apply our theory-driven evaluation rubric at scale.
Qualitative Analysis of the Interview Data
To extract meaningful insights from the interviews, we con-
ducted a bottom-up inductive analysis of the interview tran-
scripts. The first three authors collaboratively reviewed three
transcripts to identify descriptors of participant responses
(or codes) that informed the development of a preliminary
codebook. This codebook was refined through an iterative
process and subsequently used to code the remaining tran-
scripts. Throughout this process, the authors added memos,
noted key observations, and captured participants’ perspec-
tives on stereotypes, preferences, and expectations related
to AI-generated images. Then, we employed a micro-board
affinity diagramming to organize the codes, enabling us to
cluster insights and identify emerging patterns across par-
ticipants. Finally, we applied reflexive thematic analysis to
interpret the clusters and synthesize themes related to users’
perceptions of stereotypical cues in T2I outputs and the at-
tributes that shaped their preferences and judgments.Dall-E Midjourney Stability AI Aggregated

Evaluating Initial and Refined T2I Outputs
Table 4 provides an overview of SSI and Table 2 shows
stereotype breakdown by rubric categories for the T2I out-
puts. Interestingly, we find that SSIwas comparable across
the three T2I models. Table 3 provides a few examples of the
initial and refined outputs from the three T2I models, across
the three query types. Overall, the refined outputs show sig-
nificantly lower SSI than the initial outputs as per t-tests
(p<0.001). We elaborate on our findings below.
Geocultural Queries Forgeocultural queries, we observe
a reduction in stereotypical bias—the mean SSI dropped
from 0.36 (initial) to 0.14 (refined), reflecting a 61.11% de-
crease that is statistically significant ( t=12.55, p<0.001). We
note a substantial reduction in stereotypes related to clothing
(14.2%→4.7%), lifestyle (13.4% →4.4%), and props/objects
(9.4%→2.9%) (ref: Figure 2).
We manually inspected the outputs to find that the ini-
tial images often relied on strong cultural markers—such
as headscarves, beards, traditional clothing—and regional
settings associated with specific ethnic groups. For in-
stance, queries referencing Global South regions (e.g., a
Bangladeshi person ) produced images often featuring mar-
kets and rural settings. On the other hand, queries referenc-
ing Western regions (e.g., a French person ) often included
urban spaces such as coffee shops and bakeries. These ele-
ments suggest that T2I models often relied on surface-level
visual tropes to localize geocultural queries.
In contrast, the refined images presented a more neutral
or globally representative portrayal. Rather than emphasiz-
ing region-specific features, these tended to include more di-
verse settings, such as urban environments or social gath-
erings. For example, the query for a Bangladeshi person
yielded refined outputs featuring cityscapes, social events,
or even corporate office scenes. Notably, to supposedly sig-
nal “diversity,” the refined outputs often depicted multiple
individuals rather than a single subject. These observations
reveal to a key tradeoff: although refined prompts can po-
tentially reduce stereotypical bias, it can also dilute cul-
tural specificity—raising questions about balancing stereo-
type mitigation with authentic representation.
Occupational Queries Foroccupational queries, we find
that the mean SSI decreased from 0.35 (initial) to 0.11
(refined), indicating a 68.57% improvement in bias re-
duction with statistical significance ( t=15.19, p<0.001).
We found a major reduction in stereotypes related to age
(14.1%→4.9%), gender (17.8% →8.1%), and race/ethnicity
(11.4%→4.0%) (ref: Figure 2).
We observed that occupational queries often revealed gen-
der and racial biases in initial T2I outputs. For example, men
were predominantly depicted in corporate or leadership roles
(e.g., a CEO, a manager ), often accompanied by stereotyp-
ical elements such as formal business attire and assertive
expressions. In contrast, women were more commonly de-
picted in support roles, such as librarians or secretaries.Age

These patterns align with prior findings in search engine and
AI-generated imagery (Kay, Matuszek, and Munson 2015;
Wang et al. 2023; Wan and Chang 2024).
In contrast, the refined T2I outputs reduced traditional vi-
sual stereotypes, particularly for setting and presentation.
We found that formal dress codes were relaxed, settings be-
came more varied, and subjects were often depicted in col-
laborative or group contexts with casual and positive expres-
sions. For instance, a CEO resulted in images of a diverse
group of formally-dressed individuals in an office setting
around a conference table, moving away from an authori-
tative white male figure as seen in initial images. However,
gender and racial biases in the primary subjects often per-
sisted. For instance, a musician continued to generate im-
ages of a black man with a guitar—though now placed in
a public concert setting rather than an isolated studio. Simi-
larly, a dietitian still yielded only female-presenting individ-
uals, with the primary change being a shift to public-facing
environments. These examples suggest that, while prompt
refinement mitigated some surface-level stereotypes, deeper
identity-based biases remained largely intact.Adjectival Queries Like the other two categories, for ad-
jectival queries, the mean SSI dropped from 0.37 (initial)
to 0.18 (refined), indicating a 51.35% improvement in bias
reduction with statistical significance ( t=16.35, p<0.001).
Figure 2 reveals a major reduction in age (6.0% →0.9%) and
gender (16.2% →8.5%) stereotypes. However, we did not
find a huge difference in race/ethnicity-based stereotypes,
which was already low to begin with (4.9% →3.4%).
We observed that the initial images tended to reinforce
societal stereotypes, such as beauty standards and the over-
representation of features associated with Western cul-
tures. For example, queries such as furious andrude led
to male-presenting individuals, whereas beautiful predom-
inantly generated white-skinned women—reflecting narrow
cultural norms and a lack of ethnic diversity. These depic-
tions aligned with symbolic cues in the queries but failed to
represent the broader global population.
In contrast, the refined images showed some improve-
ment, often featuring group scenes and greater diversity
in skin tone and appearance. For example, beautiful pro-
duced a more racially diverse set of representations. Simi-larly, furious included individuals presenting a wider range
of racial backgrounds, but the images remained exclusively
male-presenting. This suggests that while prompt refinement
helped broaden visual representation, certain gendered inter-
pretations of adjectives remained persistent.
Understanding User Perceptions
Alignment of T2I Outputs to Participants’ Mental Im-
age During the mental image elicitation section, partici-
pants were first asked to describe or sketch the expected re-
sults for a set of queries. Then, they viewed the T2I out-
puts using a search-style interface, which enabled side-by-
side comparison between their expectations and T2I outputs.
We observed that participants tended to focus on specific
visual cues—such as background, pose, facial expression,
and clothing—particularly when queries contained cultural
or occupational elements. Interestingly, attributes such as
gender or ethnicity were rarely mentioned in participants’
initial expectations unless these features were highly salient
in the image—especially for geocultural andoccupational
queries. Some participants even expressed a preference for
stereotypical features, suggesting that certain biases may
align with their expectations shaped by prior personal and
cultural experience. Some also noted that certain images felt
“animated” or “synthetic.” This was most commonly ob-
served in DALL-E outputs, where exaggerated or caricature-
like features reduced perceived realism. In contrast, images
from Midjourney and Stability AI were often described as
more “photorealistic” and “appealing.” We describe the ma-
jor themes we identified from our qualitative analyses below.
A preference for familiar stereotype, but a desire for di-
versity. We observed a nuanced tension in participants’
preferences—while they expressed a desire for diverse rep-
resentations in T2I outputs, they often gravitated toward fa-
miliar, stereotypical portrayals. Although many valued di-
versity, their expectations often defaulted to culturally famil-
iar or stereotypical representations, particularly in terms of
skin tone, gender, age, and cultural signifiers, unless explic-
itly specified otherwise. For example, P2 reflected on how
they processed these cues for a Bangladeshi person :
“I might be inclined more toward expecting facial hair and
dark skin [..] if you present these clothes and the beard, I’ll
probably just take it that way.”—P2
At the same time, P2 also expressed disappointment when
diversity was lacking, noting, “There’s no male depictions,
and I think I would have liked to see that” , when evaluating
outputs for a beautiful person .
We also observed a shift in perception. For example, when
shown the initial image set of a beautiful person —featuring
stereotypical beauty norms of Western features, lighter skin
tones, and feminity—P17 expressed that it aligned with their
expectation of beauty. However, upon viewing the refined
image set with more diverse representations, they came to
recognize and appreciate the value of inclusive imagery:
“The [diverse beautiful representation] is better because
there is diversity in different ways. The 2nd lady is in a suit-
/formal clothes. The 1st one is in traditional clothes, the 3rd
one is in kind of formal clothes. And it is nice too because
there are different kinds of ethnicities and genders.”—P17
Stereotypical shortcuts in embodied identity representa-
tion. We found that embodied characteristics serve as pow-
erful shortcuts for conveying identity in AI-generated im-
agery. Embodied features, such as posture, facial expres-sions, gestures, and clothing, were often recognized as sig-
nals that reinforced conventional assumptions about an iden-
tity. For example, P2 described a a manager as:
“I imagine him at a computer or in a meeting with col-
leagues [..] probably dressed in business attire in a bright
office environment.”—P2
This description highlights how specific bodily position-
ing (“at a computer” or “in a meeting”) and clothing choices
(“business attire”) serve as embodied markers that signal a
professional identity. Likewise, P7 described a scientist :
“He wears a large white coat [..] he wears his huge glasses,
and usually he will have a laptop or a notebook in his hand,
and his facial expression will be very focused, concentrated
on the experiment that he is doing.”—P7
The above description reveals how the participants held
composite stereotypes that combined visual identity markers
with specific embodied characteristics, including clothing
(lab coat), accessories (glasses), props (laptop/notebook),
and facial expressions (focused concentration). Therefore,
postures, expressions, and clothing styles were interpreted
differently based on perceived gender, age, or culture—
revealing participants’ awareness of embodied representa-
tions as a system of visual codes that both reflect and rein-
force social roles and expectations.
Contextual environments as stereotypical cues. Partic-
ipants prioritized environmental settings, props, and sur-
rounding objects as significant carriers of stereotypical
meaning in images. Multiple participants showed sensitiv-
ity to contextual elements that signaled stereotypical as-
sumptions, such as background settings that reinforced cul-
tural or socioeconomic associations. When discussing ex-
pected background elements, P13 associated a specific type
of background with a French person:
“I’d expect to see narrow streets, buildings with balconies,
maybe some flowers or a small cafe in the background. I
also think of things like maybe the Eiffel Tower or a street
artist painting. It’s usually a calm, classic vibe, like what
you see in pictures of Paris.” —P13
This association reveals how deeply ingrained certain en-
vironmental markers are as cultural signifiers that oper-
ate for specific identities and geographical locations. These
observations highlight how background elements not only
contribute to aesthetic quality, but also shape interpretation
through cultural and national associations. This suggests that
environmental framing functions as a powerful but often
overlooked mechanism through which stereotypical associ-
ations are reinforced in AI-generated imagery.
Personal experience as a filter for stereotype interpreta-
tion. Participants often drew on lived experiences when
forming mental image, revealing how such experiences and
social context shape their interpretations of stereotypical
representations. We noted that some stereotypes can in-
ternally be rooted in a deeply subjective process filtered
through an individual’s real-life interactions and relation-
ships. Individuals who had direct personal connections to
the groups or professions represented often exhibited height-
ened sensitivity to stereotypical cues. Their assessments
were grounded in familiar imagery drawn from actual peo-
ple in their lives. For example, when asked about the image
ofa scientist , one participant referred to their roommate:
“So for scientists, I can imagine a photo of my roommate,
who is a PhD student in the physics department. I think he
works in material science. Let’s focus on the visual part, hewears a jacket with huge glasses, and his hairstyle is kind
of messy because he focused on the experiments.”—P7
The above response reveals how personal connections
provide a concrete reference for stereotypical representa-
tions. Similarly, P10 described imagining a woman based
on their personal experience as an artist:
“Women tend to own handbags, lipstick, dresses, and
makeup. [The background] can be a shade of pink.”—P10
Here, personal experience guided the participant’s men-
tal representation, reinforcing how familiarity with specific
traits or visual elements can influence what is perceived as
typical or expected. These examples underscore the role of
lived experience as both a cognitive shortcut and a subjective
filter in interpreting AI-generated images.
Concerns about stereotype perpetuation. Some partici-
pants voiced significant concerns about the potential societal
impacts of stereotype perpetuation in AI-generated imagery.
They were aware of how these systems can reinforce harm-
ful stereotypes through repetition and amplification, e.g.,:
“I think a lot of the [AI-generated image] models and al-
gorithms are created by people who [are] trained on just
stereotypes [..] I am nervous that the use of AI is just going
to continue to exacerbate certain stereotypes and percep-
tions [..] I think they’ll definitely worsen those stereotypes
and continue to perpetuate the idea that a non-Hispanic
white man is the ideal, and what everyone should be striving
for, and kind of the concept of like average.”—P15
P14 shared a similar concern with respect to racial biases:
“In the context of racism, it will produce an image without
knowing its impacts, its negative impacts to the people that
will see the photos.”—P14
P17 also raised concerns about the potential misuse of re-
alistic AI-generated imagery for harmful purposes:
“My concern is, since these photos look so real, people can
just use [AI-generated image] technology as a tool [..] and
use it to serve criminal purposes. I think there should be
more laws that restrict this area. ”—P17
Despite these concerns, P15 also acknowledged AI’s poten-
tial to improve representation when designed intentionally:
“When I previously worked in a job where we [worked]
with BIPOC individuals, it was a challenge to always find
good images [..] potentially, it could be useful to have AI to
help produce that.” —P15
This complex perspective highlights the tension between
concerns about stereotype reinforcement and recognition of
potential benefits in diversifying visual representation.
Rapid Fire: Initial vs. Refined T2I Outputs In the sec-
ond section of the interviews—the rapid-fire comparison
task—participants were asked to compare initial and refined
outputs corresponding to a set of queries one by one. Inter-
estingly, we observed a relatively balanced distribution of
preferences between the initial and refined T2I outputs. The
17 participants did a total of 153 comparisons (9 compar-
isons each)—in these 47.06% were reported to be in favor
of refined outputs, 43.14% in favor of initial outputs, and
9.80% were similar/undecided preference. In addition, we
found that the accuracy of the T2I output to the initial query
was not always the primary factor driving user preference—
participants often favored images that felt more relatable,
contextually appropriate, or visually pleasing, even when
those images were less accurate. This observation suggests
that end-users might prioritize resonance with mental imageor visual appeal over technical accuracy, depending on their
underlying expectations. In other words, contextual framing
shapes users’ perceptions of how “socially correct” an AI-
generated image should be.
6 Discussion
Can we “debias” social stereotypes in T2I outputs? Our
study showed that combining a theory-driven rubric with
LLM-based prompt refinement effectively reduced stereo-
types in T2I outputs. We quantified stereotype biases in T2I
outputs using a Social Stereotype Index ( SSI) and applied
our intervention across three query types— geocultural ,
occupational , and adjectival —using three state-of-the-art
models (DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stability AI). In all
cases, prompt refinement significantly lowered SSI.
That said, we noted distinct tradeoffs in each of the three
query types. For geocultural queries, we observed a ten-
sion between cultural specificity and stereotype mitigation.
Foroccupational prompts, setting-level diversity improved,
but deeper identity-based biases remained. For adjectival
prompts, gendered associations were persistent despite vi-
sual broadening. These findings highlight the broader chal-
lenge of debiasing—fine-tuning models or curating new
datasets is costly, whereas prompt refinement offers a scal-
able, model-agnostic solution that can improve inclusivity
without altering model architecture.
Beyond technical metrics, our qualitative study revealed
that users’ interpretations are shaped not only by visual
content, but also by personal preferences, expectations, and
context. Notably, users weighed the trade-off between rep-
resentational accuracy and ethical alignment differently—
highlighting the need for human-in-the-loop evaluation
mechanisms that can account for the subjective and value-
laden nature of biases. Therefore, our work contributes to the
growing discourse on responsible generative AI, by inspir-
ing practical tools and conceptual frameworks for socially
inclusive image generation. It highlights how identifying vi-
sual attributes linked to stereotype amplification can inform
both prompt-level interventions and model outcomes.
Red-teamed, yet still biased: Lessons from popular T2I
systems Although our findings reveal the effectiveness of
prompt refinement in reducing social biases in T2I out-
puts, it is important to contextualize these results. We au-
dited state-of-the-art models—DALL-E, Midjourney, and
Stability AI—that have already undergone substantial red-
teaming and continual audits before being released to the
public. These models represent some of the most “safe”
and publicly scrutinized generative systems currently avail-
able, which likely moderates the severity of observable bias.
Yet, even under these conservative conditions, we found the
prevalence as well as the reduction of stereotyped outputs.
This suggests that the same technique may lead to
even greater improvements for less-moderated or fine-tuned
models—such as early-stage commercial deployments or
third-party applications—where moderation is minimal or
opaque. In these “black-box” settings, models often priori-
tize fidelity to user input, which can default to stereotypical
visual cues. In contrast, our approach prioritizes ethical con-
siderations through lightweight prompt restructuring, often
producing more inclusive but somewhat generalized images.
This tradeoff is illustrated in Figure 4, where the query a
photo of a felon initially produced an image with a high SSI
(0.77), marked by stereotypical features (e.g., race, gender,
clothing). After prompt refinement, SSIdropped to 0.33, butInitial Images Refined ImagesFigure 4: Images generated for A photo of a felon . The initial

the image seemingly diverged from the original query. This
case highlights the fundamental tension between maintain-
ing prompt fidelity and mitigating representational harm—a
critical consideration for ethical T2I design.
Toward stereotype-aware T2I systems Our study bears
methodological implications in rubric-driven prompt refine-
ment as a practical and cost-effective strategy, particularly
for addressing setting- and environment-level biases. In-
ternal prompt rewriting—guided by templates or theory-
informed heuristics—can be embedded within the genera-
tion pipeline to make systems more inclusive without re-
training or re-engineering. This approach can effectively di-
versifying occupational and geocultural contexts, which of-
ten default to Western or male-centric representations.
However, we found that this approach also has limited in-
fluence on the focal subject of the image. Unless explicitly
specified, models continued to default to dominant demo-
graphic groups—reflecting biases in training data and model
priors. To address this gap, we recommend pairing prompt
refinement with subject-aware interventions, such as identity
balancing, user feedback mechanisms, or post-hoc audits of
focal subjects. These approaches can help ensure inclusivity
in context and representation, supporting the development of
scalable stereotype-aware systems.
Beyond Debiasing: Oversight and Policy Implica-
tions Beyond technical design, our findings raise broader
questions about the governance of generative AI systems.
Not all stereotypical cues are inherently harmful; many
function as contextually meaningful signals that improve
clarity and cultural relevance. For instance, depicting a sushi
chef in traditional regional attire can enhance authenticity
rather than introduce bias. However, blanket removal of such
cues risks producing sanitized, culturally flattened outputs.
This is particularly important in occupational andgeocul-
tural queries, where users may expect certain visual cues
to convey identity, profession, or region. We call for tax-
onomies and conceptual frameworks that distinguish harm-
ful stereotypes from contextually appropriate depictions, in-
tegrate community input into system design, and promote
transparency in defining and operationalizing fairness.
However, as T2I systems become embedded in public-
facing platforms, the risk of normalizing stereotypes in-
creases. In contexts where generated images are perceived
as objective or authoritative, these biases can reinforce dom-
inant narratives and marginalize others. Therefore, it is crit-
ical to have oversight and regulations with these tools.
For instance, independent audits, explainability standards,
and enforceable fairness benchmarks are needed to ensureaccountability—particularly when systems shape perception
subtly and at scale. As some of our interview findings sug-
gest, in the absence of such safeguards, generative models
may shape public imagination in ways that reinforce, rather
than challenge, societal bias.
Limitations and Future Directions
Our study has limitations which suggest interesting future
directions. To begin with, we only focused on a limited set of
queries and three diffusion-based state-of-the-art T2I mod-
els. Future research could broaden both queries and models
for greater representational coverage.
In addition, our SSImetric, though quantitative, depends
on predefined rubrics that may miss subtler forms of bias
or embed assumptions about what counts as stereotypi-
cal. A more adaptive evaluation framework—possibly in-
tegrating human-in-the-loop or culturally contextualized in-
puts—could offer richer insight. As our interviews suggest,
stereotype identification is inherently subjective, underscor-
ing broader challenges in operationalizing social constructs
for algorithmic assessment. We also observed how our
prompt refinement strategy prioritized stereotype reduction,
sometimes at the cost of cultural specificity. Our work moti-
vates future work to explore ways to balance bias mitigation
without removing meaningful cultural markers.
Finally, the user study involved 17 participants based in
the U.S., limiting its cross-cultural generalizability. In our
study, some participants were unfamiliar with certain cul-
tures. For example, an East Asian participant (P2), unsure
about Bangladeshi appearance, based their mental image
on Indian friends due to regional proximity. However, they
felt more confident describing a Japanese person, reflecting
closer cultural familiarity. This motivates future work ex-
ploring how demographic background influences mental im-
agery and bias perception across participant groups. Impor-
tantly, each individual may already have their own biases,
and disentangling user predispositions from AI-generated
biases was outside the scope of this work. A deeper theo-
retical examination, as well as broader engagement with di-
verse user groups through large survey studies, will be cru-
cial to understanding generalizable and global perceptions
of stereotype and representation in T2I outputs.
7 Conclusion
We examined whether social stereotypes could be automat-
ically detected and quantified in images generated by text-
to-image (T2I) models—DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stabil-
ity AI—across 100 queries spanning geocultural ,occupa-
tional , and adjectival categories. We developed a theory-
driven rubric and operationalized a Social Stereotype Index
(SSI). Then we used the rubric with GPT-4o to automati-
cally detect and identify biases in our T2I dataset, and man-
ually evaluated its quality to be show ∼88% accuracy. We
conducted prompt refinements, which led to a ∼61% av-
erage reduction in SSI, demonstrating the effectiveness of
rubric-based interventions. Finally, we conducted a qualita-
tive mental-model elicitation study to understand how end-
users perceive stereotypes in T2I outputs. We found a key
tension—while prompt refinement can mitigate stereotypes,
it can limit relevance and contextual alignment.
Ethics and Reflexivity Statement
Our study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
(IRB) of our institution. Given the potentially sensitive na-ture of the study, we followed multiple ethical considera-
tions, including assigning participants unique IDs to ensure
anonymity and taking deliberate steps to respect cultural
sensitivities, such as using inclusive language and allow-
ing participants to skip or rephrase prompts they found un-
comfortable. Our interdisciplinary research team comprises
individuals with diverse gender, racial, and cultural back-
grounds, including people of color and immigrants, and has
interdisciplinary expertise in the areas of human-computer
interaction, computational social science, and AI ethics. We
have prior experience auditing sociotechnical and AI sys-
tems and take a critical stance in examining their potential
harms and societal consequences, while simultaneously sup-
porting diversity and inclusivity in AI models and outcomes.
While our lived experiences uniquely inform our interpre-
tation of geocultural and demographic stereotypes, we ac-
knowledge that these perspectives may not universally gen-
eralize across cultures. However, we believe our contribution
and artifacts can be adapted across broader contexts with ap-
propriate adjustments.

these sets; in this particular example, set A is from the refined output, and set B is from the initial output.• Your task is to evaluate a set of [I] generated with the prompt [Q]] for
potential social stereotypical biases based on predefined questions [R].
• For each question, score 1 if a stereotype is present OR score 0 if no stereotype
is present.
• Explain the reasoning and image number(s) behind your evaluation.
• Provide the output in a JSON format.

Given the initial query: [Q] and the image [I] generated with this query, generate a
new image prompt that addresses any potential negative social stereotypes [S].
• Make sure your final prompt: 1) Eliminates or minimizes specific stereotypes
identified in your analysis., 2) Maintains a single, cohesive scene without
fragmented or collage-like elements., and 3) Retains the core idea and purpose of
the initial prompt.
• Format the final prompt as: [Q] [additional refined context to reduce negative
