Abstract
Background and objective: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a novel ultrasound modality with diagnostic accu-
racy comparable to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).
This study investigated whether interpretation of micro-US by artificial intelligence (AI) can outperform clinical
screening methods using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and digital rectal examination (DRE).
Methods: We retrospectively studied 145 men who underwent micro-US guided biopsy (79 with csPCa and 66
without). A self-supervised convolutional autoencoder was trained to extract deep image features from 2D micro-
US slices. Random forest classifiers were developed using five-fold cross-validation to predict csPCa at the slice
level. A patient was classified as csPCa-positive if ≥8 consecutive slices were predicted positive. Model per-
formance was compared with a classifier trained on common clinical screening variables (PSA, DRE, prostate
volume, and age).
Key findings and limitations: The AI-enhanced micro-US model and the clinical screening model achieved AU-
ROCs of 0.871 and 0.753, respectively. Using a fixed classification threshold for both models, the micro-US model
achieved a sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 68.1%, while the clinical model achieved a sensitivity of 96.2%
but with a lower specificity at 27.3%. Limitations of this study include its retrospective single-center design and
lack of external validation.
Conclusions and clinical implications: AI-interpreted micro-US significantly improves specificity for csPCa
while maintaining high sensitivity. This approach may reduce unnecessary biopsies and o ffers a low-cost, point-
of-care alternative to PSA-based screening. Future prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.
Patient summary: We developed an artificial intelligence system to analyze micro-ultrasound images of the
prostate. In this study, it detected aggressive prostate cancer more accurately than traditional screening meth-
ods such as PSA blood tests and digital rectal exams. This approach may help reduce unnecessary biopsies in the
future.

1. Introduction
Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly di-
agnosed malignancies and a leading cause of cancer-
related death worldwide (James et al., 2024). Early de-
tection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa)
is critical, as it increases the 5-year survival rate from
37% to nearly 100% (Society, 2025). Clinically,
screening often relies on prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) testing and digital rectal examination (DRE),
but both methods have notable limitations. PSA lacks
specificity and may be elevated in benign conditions
such as benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis.
DRE, while inexpensive and easy to perform, su ffers
from poor sensitivity and high inter-observer variabil-
ity. As a result, these traditional tools can lead to both

unnecessary biopsies or delayed detection of aggres-
sive disease.
Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging
(mpMRI) improves the detection of csPCa and is
commonly used to guide targeted biopsies (Ahmed
et al., 2017). However, its role in routine screening is
limited by high cost, long acquisition times, limited
availability, and the need for specialized radiological
expertise. These constraints make mpMRI impractical
for large-scale or point-of-care screening. Micro-
ultrasound (micro-US), a high-resolution (29 MHz)
imaging modality, provides real-time visualization of
prostate microarchitecture with spatial resolution three
to four times greater than conventional transrectal
ultrasound (Klotz et al., 2020). The OPTIMUM
randomized trial confirmed that micro-US–guided
biopsy is noninferior to MRI-targeted biopsy forarXiv:2505.21355v1  [eess.IV]  27 May 2025detecting csPCa (Kinnaird et al., 2025). With its porta-
bility, lower cost, and suitability for outpatient use,
micro-US is well positioned as a potential screening
tool. However, interpretation remains challenging and
highly operator-dependent (Zhou et al., 2024), limiting
consistent performance and widespread adoption.
To address the interpretive limitations of micro-
ultrasound, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)
model to automatically detect csPCa from micro-US
images. Using a retrospective cohort of 145 men
who underwent micro-US–guided prostate biopsy, we
trained a self-supervised convolutional autoencoder
to extract deep imaging features from 2D micro-US
slices. These features were used to train a ran-
dom forest classifier for slice-level prediction, and
patient-level prediction was determined by aggregat-
ing predictions across consecutive slices. We com-
pared this model to a classifier trained on standard clin-
ical screening variables including PSA, DRE, prostate
volume, and age. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to align micro-US imaging with biopsy-
confirmed pathology at the slice level and to per-
form patient-level csPCa screening predictions using
AI. This work evaluates the potential of AI-enhanced
micro-US as a practical and accurate tool for prostate
cancer screening.
2. Patients and methods
2.1. Patient population and data description
This retrospective study was approved by the Uni-
versity of Florida Institutional Review Board and
included 145 men who underwent micro-ultrasound
(micro-US)–guided prostate biopsy. All patients had
clinical indications for biopsy, such as elevated PSA
and/or an abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE).
Most patients also underwent a systematic 12-core
biopsy, including those without visible micro-US le-
sions. During biopsy, the operator recorded needle tra-
jectories and target locations using micro-US images,
enabling retrospective mapping of cores to correspond-
ing regions. All patients provided informed consent.
Ground truth for csPCa was established by histopatho-
logical analysis of all biopsy cores. Patients were clas-
sified as csPCa-positive if any core contained Gleason
score≥3+4. Baseline patient characteristics are sum-
marized in Table 1.
2.1.1. Micro-ultrasound imaging
Pre-biopsy micro-US scans were acquired using a
29 MHz transrectal system (ExactVu, Exact Imag-
ing, Markham, Canada) by an experienced urologist
(WGB) with four years of micro-US interpretation ex-
perience. Scans were recorded at 10 frames per second
for up to 30 seconds, producing 200 to 300 2D micro-
US slices per scan.2.1.2. Clinical biomarkers
For each patient, we collected the following clini-
cal biomarkers: PSA, DRE findings, age, and prostate
volume. Prostate volume was estimated from the pre-
biopsy micro-US scan. We used the MicroSegNet
model (Jiang et al., 2024) to segment the prostate cap-
sule on each 2D slice, and reconstructed the segmen-
tations into a 3D volume using the method described
in (Imran et al., 2024). The final prostate gland vol-
ume (in mL) was computed from the reconstructed 3D
model.
2.1.3. Slice-level labeling for model training
Model training required slice-level annotations in-
dicating the presence or absence of csPCa on each
2D micro-ultrasound (micro-US) slice. For csPCa-
negative patients, all slices were labeled as negative.
For csPCa-positive patients, operator-recorded needle
trajectories were used to cognitively map each biopsy
core to the corresponding region on the pre-biopsy
micro-US scan. An expert urologist (WGB) manually
reviewed slices surrounding these trajectories to as-
sess csPCa extent, using sonographic features defined
in the PRI-MUS protocol (Ma ffei et al., 2024). Slices
with suspicious features were labeled as positive. All
other slices in csPCa-positive cases were excluded
from training, as their cancer status could not be con-
fidently determined in the absence of histopathologi-
cal confirmation. In total, 2,062 positive and 14,769
negative slices were included. Model evaluation was
conducted at the patient level, using biopsy-confirmed
csPCa status to reflect clinically meaningful outcomes.
2.2. Model development and evaluation
2.2.1. Micro-US image feature extraction
We trained a convolutional autoencoder with self-
supervised learning to extract high-level features from
micro-US images. The autoencoder (Figure 1) consists
of two symmetric components: a convolutional en-
coder gϕand a decoder fϕ. The encoder compresses the
input image xinto a lower-dimensional latent represen-
tation z, while the decoder attempts to reconstruct the
original image from z. The encoder includes five con-
volutional layers with increasing channel dimensions
(from 3 to 256), interleaved with ReLU activations and
strided convolutions for spatial downsampling. The
decoder mirrors this structure with transposed convolu-
tions and corresponding upsampling layers to produce
the reconstructed image. The autoencoder was trained
to minimize the mean squared error between the input
image xand the reconstructed output x′. After training,
we used the encoder as a fixed feature extractor. Each
2D micro-US slice was passed through the encoder to
generate a feature map, which was then reduced via
adaptive average pooling to obtain a 256-dimensional
feature vector.

ture extraction.
2.2.2. Micro-US image classification
We trained random forest classifiers to classify 2D
micro-US slices as csPCa-positive or negative us-
ing 256-dimensional feature vectors extracted by the
autoencoder’s encoder, which captured key imaging
characteristics such as texture, intensity, and shape.
Slice-level predictions were aggregated to produce
patient-level classifications. A patient was considered
csPCa-positive if at least eight consecutive slices were
predicted positive. This rule was based on retrospec-
tive analysis of lesion length, which showed that csPCa
typically spanned eight adjacent slices on average. Re-
quiring spatially contiguous predictions helped reduce
false positives and improved specificity without com-
promising sensitivity.
2.2.3. Classification with clinical biomarkers
To assess the predictive value of commonly used
screening tools, we trained a random forest model us-
ing only non-imaging features: patient age, PSA level,
prostate volume, and the binary outcome of DRE.
Since the scikit-learn implementation supports in-
ternal out-of-bag (OOB) validation, a separate valida-
tion set was not required for hyperparameter tuning.
2.2.4. Cross-validation strategy
We used five-fold cross-validation to ensure robust
and unbiased model evaluation. The dataset, con-
sisting of 79 csPCa-positive and 66 csPCa-negative
patients, was partitioned into five mutually exclusive
folds. Each patient appeared exactly once in the test
set, once in the validation set, and in the training set
for the remaining three folds. This approach ensured
that all cases contributed to both training and evalu-
ation while preventing data leakage. For each fold,
training was monitored on the validation set to preventoverfitting, and the model checkpoint with the lowest
validation loss was retained.
2.2.5. Implementation details
All autoencoder models were implemented in
PyTorch (v1.13) and trained on an NVIDIA A100
GPU using the Adam optimizer (learning rate =0.001,
batch size =32). After training, the decoder was dis-
carded and the encoder was used as a fixed feature ex-
tractor. Each random forest model was trained with
1,000 trees, class-balanced weights, and stratified sam-
pling to preserve the distribution of positive and neg-
ative slices. Records with missing clinical values or
duplicate patient entries were removed to ensure data
integrity.
2.2.6. Peformance metrics
We evaluated model performance at the patient level
using the following metrics: area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUROC), accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. All
metrics were averaged across the five cross-validation
folds. AUROC served as the primary evaluation
metric, as it captures overall discriminatory perfor-
mance across all classification thresholds. The remain-
ing metrics were computed using a fixed probability
threshold of 0.15, which was empirically selected to
balance sensitivity and specificity in the training data.
3. Results
3.1. ROC-based comparison of imaging and clinical
models
Figure 2 shows the ROC curves comparing the per-
formance of the imaging-based model and the clini-
cal biomarker model. The clinical model, trained on
age, PSA, DRE, and prostate volume, achieved a mean
AUROC of 0.753, indicating moderate discriminative
ability. In contrast, the imaging-based model achieved
a higher AUROC of 0.871, reflecting a stronger ability
to distinguish csPCa from non-csPCa based on deep
features extracted from micro-US slices.

rics across five cross-validation folds. The clinical

model achieved high sensitivity (96.2%) but low speci-
ficity (27.3%), resulting in a high false-positive rate.
Its precision (61.4%), F1-score (74.9%), and accu-
racy (64.8%) were moderate. In contrast, the imag-
ing model maintained high sensitivity (92.5%) while
substantially improving specificity (68.1%). It also
achieved higher precision (77.8%), F1-score (84.5%),
and accuracy (81.4%), demonstrating a better over-
all balance between true-positive detection and false-
positive control.

Micro-US 92.5% 68.1% 81.4% 77.8% 84.5%
These results highlight that the AI-based imaging
model o ffers a more favorable trade-o ffbetween sensi-
tivity and specificity, reducing unnecessary false posi-
tives while maintaining robust detection of clinically
significant disease. This supports its potential as a
more accurate and e fficient screening tool for csPCa.
4. Discussion
This study demonstrates that an AI-enhanced micro-
US model can significantly improve prostate can-
cer screening performance compared to traditional
biomarker-based approaches. While the clinical
model, which incorporated PSA, DRE, prostate vol-
ume, and age, achieved high sensitivity (96.2%), it
exhibited poor specificity (27.3%), consistent with
well-documented limitations of PSA-based screen-
ing (Thompson et al., 2004; Schr ¨oder et al., 1998).
In contrast, the imaging-based model maintained
high sensitivity (92.5%) while substantially improving
specificity (68.1%), resulting in better overall accuracy
and precision. This improved balance is particularlyimportant in a screening context, where reducing false
positives can lower the burden of unnecessary biopsies,
overtreatment, and patient anxiety.
Micro-US has been proposed as a lower-cost, point-
of-care alternative to multiparametric MRI for prostate
cancer detection (Klotz et al., 2020; Lughezzani et al.,
2019). Prior studies, including the OPTIMUM ran-
domized trial, have shown that micro-US is non-
inferior to MRI for csPCa detection in biopsy set-
tings (Kinnaird et al., 2025). However, its broader use
in screening has been limited by high inter-operator
variability and a steep learning curve (Zhou et al.,
2024). Our results suggest that artificial intelligence
can help overcome these barriers by enabling consis-
tent, objective interpretation of micro-US images. The
self-supervised autoencoder used in this study learned
imaging features correlated with csPCa, which were
then aggregated using a slice-level prediction frame-
work to produce patient-level classifications. This ap-
proach e ffectively eliminates reliance on subjective in-
terpretation and may help standardize micro-US for
widespread clinical adoption.
Previous models, such as TRUSformer (Gilany
et al., 2023) and TRUSWorthy (Harmanani et al.,
2025), have focused on patch-level classification using
weak labels, limiting their clinical interpretability. In
contrast, our model aligned individual micro-US slices
with biopsy-confirmed pathology and used an empiri-
cally chosen aggregation rule to generate patient-level
predictions. This method mirrors clinical decision-
making and supports actionable, real-time screening
decisions. The improved diagnostic performance, par-
ticularly in specificity and F1-score, underscores the
potential of AI-enhanced micro-US to function as a
frontline screening modality that complements or even
outperforms existing PSA- and DRE-based strategies.
Despite encouraging results, this study has limita-
tions. The cohort was drawn from a single academic
center and consisted of patients already referred for
biopsy, which may introduce selection bias. As such,
performance in general screening populations remains
to be validated. While five-fold cross-validation was
used to minimize overfitting, external validation on in-
dependent cohorts is necessary to assess generalizabil-
ity. Additionally, the threshold for patient-level clas-
sification (eight consecutive positive slices) was em-
pirically defined and may require adjustment in fu-
ture prospective settings. Future work should include
multicenter clinical trials, decision-curve analysis, and
cost-e ffectiveness studies to evaluate the real-world
impact of integrating AI-enhanced micro-US into rou-
tine prostate cancer screening. If validated, this ap-
proach could provide a scalable, a ffordable, and inter-
pretable solution for early detection of clinically sig-
nificant prostate cancer, bridging the gap between low-
specificity biomarker screening and high-cost MRI-
based diagnostics.
45. Conclusions
This study indicates that AI-augmented micro-
ultrasound can outperform traditional PSA- and
DRE-based methods for screening clinically signif-
icant prostate cancer. These results highlight the
potential of micro-US, when interpreted by AI, to
serve as a point-of-care screening tool that detects
clinically significant cancers more accurately and
reduces unnecessary biopsies. If validated in prospec-
tive multi-center settings, AI-enhanced micro-US
could transform early prostate cancer detection by
enabling more precise, accessible, and cost-e ffective
screening, ultimately improving patient outcomes
while minimizing harm.
