Abstract
While large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
excel in mathematics and coding, their potential for systematic reasoning in chem-
istry, a domain demanding rigorous structural analysis for real-world tasks like
drug design and reaction engineering, remains untapped. Current benchmarks
focus on simple knowledge retrieval, neglecting step-by-step reasoning required for
complex tasks such as molecular optimization and reaction prediction. To address
this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges molecular
structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations, including addition,
deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical problem-solving into transpar-
ent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular transformations as modular
"chemical operations", the framework enables slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring
the logic of mathematical proofs while grounding solutions in real-world chemical
constraints. We evaluate models on two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property
Optimization and Chemical Reaction Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world
challenges while providing structured evaluability. By providing annotated datasets,
a reasoning taxonomy, and baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap
between abstract reasoning methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing
a foundation for advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.1 2
1 Introduction
With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning capabilities have become a
defining measure of performance. Techniques like chain-of-thought [ 64] prompting enable LLMs
to decompose complex problems into structured, human-like reasoning steps ( system-II [29]),
achieving breakthroughs in mathematics [ 47,54,67], coding [ 14,23], and even Olympiad-level
challenges [ 17,22,61]. Despite recent advances in LLM reasoning capabilities, chemistry, a discipline
fundamental to areas like drug discovery and materials science, still lacks a benchmark that assesses
whether these improvements extend to its complex, domain-specific problem-solving needs. While
several benchmarks have been proposed for LLMs in chemistry [ 16,34,38,43,69], they primarily
focus on domain-specific question answering, which suffers from several key limitations:
1. Lack of Structured, Stepwise Reasoning and Real-World Relevance: Current evaluations often
reduce chemistry assessment to factual recall (e.g., naming compounds or reactions), neglecting
the need for operational reasoning akin to arithmetic or coding. Unlike mathematical problems,
where solutions demand explicit, verifiable steps, chemistry QA tasks fail to simulate how experts

decompose challenges. For instance, they don’t capture the process of iteratively refining a molecule’s
substructure to optimize properties, considering crucial real-world factors like synthesizability or
toxicity, or deducing reaction mechanisms through intermediate transformations. This gap means
we’re not fully evaluating the analytical depth required in real-world chemistry. Therefore, evaluations
must shift from these textbook-like problems to challenges that better reflect practical applications.
2. Ambiguous Skill Attribution in Hybrid Evaluations: Existing benchmarks [ 37,50,63]
often conflate reasoning, knowledge recall, and numerical computation into single "exam-style"
metrics—for instance, asking LLMs to calculate reaction yields while simultaneously recalling
reagent properties. This obscures whether strong performance stems from structured reasoning (e.g.,
analyzing reaction pathways) or memorized facts (e.g., solvent boiling points). Such ambiguity
hinders targeted model improvement and misaligns evaluations with downstream tasks like drug
discovery, where success depends on modular reasoning (e.g., decoupling molecular design from
synthesizability checks) rather than monolithic problem-solving.
To address these limitations, we introduce ChemCoTBench , astep-by-step ,application-oriented ,
andhigh-quality benchmark for evaluating LLM reasoning in chemical applications. A core
innovation of ChemCoTBench is its formulation of complex chemical tasks, specifically targeting
molecular modeling and design (Fig.1), into explicit sequences of verifiable modular chemical
operations on SMILES structures (e.g., substructure addition, deletion, or substitution). This approach
allows for a granular assessment of an LLM’s ability to execute and chain together fundamental
chemical transformations. The benchmark features progressively challenging tasks, spanning from
basic molecular understanding and editing to property-guided structure optimization and complex
multi-molecule chemical reactions. High-quality evaluation is ensured through a dual validation
process combining LLM judgment with expert review from 13 chemists.
We employ quantitative assessments for all subtasks in ChemCoTBench to evaluate the chemical
reasoning ability across reasoning-enhanced and non-reasoning LLMs. Experimental results reveal
room for improvement in reasoning LLMs, particularly open-source and distilled-reasoning LLMs,
when addressing complex chemical problems. While these models demonstrate strong performance
in complex mathematical and coding tasks, they are unable to organize chemical knowledge and
establish step-wise modular chemical operations due to the scarcity of chemical reasoning data.
Notably, ChemCoTDataset, the large chemical CoT dataset provided by ChemCoTBench, is shown
to enhance chemical reasoning performance, effectively addressing the reasoning data scarcity issue
in Chemistry.
To summarize, our key contributions in this work are as follows: Firstly, to address the lack of reason-
ing and application-oriented tasks in existing chemical benchmarks, we propose ChemCoTBench,
which evaluates the chemical capabilities of reasoning-LLMs through step-by-step tasks centered on
molecular structure modification. Secondly, ChemCoTDataset is provided by ChemCoTBench to
facilitate LLMs on chemical reasoning. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of ChemCoTBench and its corresponding ChemCoTDataset.
22 Related Works
LLM Chain-of-Thoughts. LLMs have progressed from text generators to reasoning systems, with
[64]’s Chain-of-Thought enabling stepwise problem decomposition via "slow-thinking" paradigms.
These reasoning-enhanced LLMs have shown impressive performance in domains requiring system-
atic problem-solving skills, particularly in mathematics and coding. Models like DeepSeek-R1 [ 13],
Gemini [ 56], and Anthropic Claude [ 53] have achieved notable results on mathematical bench-
marks like MATH [ 19] and GSM8K [ 6], while also excelling at programming. Recent studies
have begun exploring LLMs for chemical tasks, such as synthesis planning [ 4] and computational
chemistry [ 26,45,51]. However, these efforts lack a systematic evaluation of LLMs’ chemical reason-
ing capabilities, spanning spatial reasoning, domain-specific knowledge integration, and multi-step
logical inference.
Chemical Benchmarks. Current chemical benchmarks primarily focus on assessing discrete
knowledge retrieval or simple prediction tasks, rather than evaluating the step-by-step reasoning
processes crucial for complex chemical problem-solving. Most existing benchmarks [ 37,38,50,63]
concentrate on question-answering formats that test factual recall and precise calculation but offer
limited insight into a model’s ability to reason through multi-step chemical problems. Studies like [ 3,
15,43] have begun exploring LLMs’ chemical capabilities but typically focus on isolated tasks rather
than comprehensive reasoning scenarios. Recent work by [ 69] introduces ChemLLM, a chemistry-
specialized LLM framework with supporting datasets, but its benchmark focuses on knowledge recall
rather than complex reasoning. Similarly, [ 15] introduces MolPuzzle, a benchmark for molecular
structure elucidation that advances spatial reasoning evaluation but remains limited to spectral
interpretation rather than broader chemical reasoning. ChemCoTBench advances chemical reasoning
evaluation by using molecular structure to guide step-by-step reasoning, featuring core chemical
arithmetic tasks and advanced cross-context applications for more thorough LLM assessment.

ChemCoTBench contains 1,495 samples across 22 chemical tasks as the benchmark dataset, as
shown in Fig 2(a). 14,000 high-quality samples with chain-of-thoughts annotations are further
sampled to form the ChemCoTDataset. ChemCoTBench was constructed through over 1,800 hours
of combined expert and LLM-assisted annotation. It comprises four main tasks and 22 subtasks,
covering a broad spectrum of chemical challenges. We define the reasoning steps of each task as
modular chemical operations, as shown in the bottom two lines of Fig. 3. ChemCoTBench is guided
by two core principles: Diversity andQuality . Molecular diversity is ensured by systematically
selecting compounds with varied scaffolds and functional groups, enabling broad coverage of real-
world chemical scenarios. To ensure high data quality, all benchmark samples undergo multi-stage
hybrid review by LLMs and expert chemists, with prompt templates iteratively refined to meet
subtask-specific requirements.
33.1 Task Construction
To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in chemistry, we constructed a comprehensive suite of tasks.
Foundation Task: Molecule-Understanding. We begin with the recognition and counting of two
fundamental elements of molecules: (1) Functional groups (FGs) , which are critical clusters of atoms
that determine the physicochemical properties and reactivity of organic molecules; (2) Rings , which
maintain fixed conformations and serve as stable building blocks in drug design, crystal engineering,
and polymer synthesis. The recognition and counting of FGs and rings, which require syntactic
and lexical understanding of SMILES, remain challenging for LLMs due to their limited chemical
topology awareness. Next, we evaluate the recognition of two more complex scaffolds: (1) Murcko
scaffolds , which are molecular frameworks obtained by systematically removing side chains and
serve as a foundation for structural analysis in medicinal chemistry; (2) Ring systems , which include
fused and bridged ring systems and pose a significant challenge for molecular synthesis. These
tasks assess deeper hierarchical comprehension. Finally, we introduce SMILES equivalence tasks,
involving permutations and mutations, to test whether LLMs can recognize chemically equivalent
structures despite surface-level variations. This probes the models’ robustness to SMILES variability.
Foundation Task: Molecule-Editing. This task assesses whether LLMs can perform basic molecular
editing operations, such as adding, deleting, and substituting functional groups, when guided by
natural language instructions. Analogous to basic arithmetic in mathematics, these editing operations
form the building blocks of molecular manipulation. Complex tasks like molecular optimization or
synthesis can be translated into specific editing operations. For example, a molecular optimization
task can be treated as a series of molecule-editing tasks aimed at improving chemical or biological
properties. This task evaluates two core capabilities: the capacity to maintain chemical validity after
editing operations and the ability to correctly execute the modifications based on textual instructions.
Application Task: Molecule-Optimization. This task evaluates whether LLMs can generate
optimized molecules given a source molecule and target property. We consider two levels of
molecular properties: At the physicochemical level , we aim to improve LogP, solubility, and QED
for improved drug-likeness. At the target level , we aim to improve binding affinity for the DRD2,
GSK3- β, and JNK3 target, which poses a more challenging task as it requires the understanding
of drug-target interactions. Solving these problems necessitates in-depth analysis and reasoning
capabilities, as LLMs must not only parse the molecular structure but also infer how specific structural
modifications influence target properties through complex chemical and biological interactions.
Application Task: Reaction Prediction. This task evaluates LLMs’ chemical reasoning ability
across four tasks: (1) Forward Prediction : Predict major products and by-products from reactants and
reagents, requiring knowledge of reactivity, reaction rules, and stability. By-product prediction aids
reaction optimization and purification by reflecting kinetics and thermodynamics. (2) Single-Step Ret-
rosynthesis : Given a product and reagents, predict reactants by identifying key bond disconnections
and functional group transformations under constraints. (3) Reaction Condition Recommendation :
Suggest catalysts, solvents, and reagents for given reactants and products, relying on understanding
of solvent effects, catalyst mechanisms, and their impact on yield and selectivity. (4) Reaction
Mechanism Understanding : Includes Next Elementary-Step Product Prediction (predicting intermedi-
ates stepwise, testing electron flow modeling) and Mechanism Route Selection (choosing the most
plausible pathway from alternatives, assessing mechanistic reasoning). Together, these tasks span
from overall product prediction to detailed mechanistic insight, providing a comprehensive test of
LLMs as chemical reasoning agents.
3.2 Benchmark Construction
Data Collection. Raw molecular structures for understanding, editing, and optimization are sourced
from published datasets, including PubChem [ 30], ChEMBL [ 11], ZINC [ 25], and Deep-Mol-
Opt [ 18]. Chemical reactions are collected from patent databases such as USPTO [ 21], Pistachio [ 42],
and Reaxys [ 8]. For reaction mechanism annotation, we refer to the processing pipeline proposed in
[28]. The complete data collection protocols are archived in the Appendix B.
Data Filtering and Sampling. An initial filtration step removed specimens exhibiting: metal-
containing compounds, excessive molecular complexity (defined by the presence of multiple sophis-
ticated functional groups and polycyclic architectures), and factually inconsistent data. To ensure
both high data diversity and broad coverage, we systematically curate diverse chemical features

For editing, we cover 57 functional group transformations. Optimization tasks span 4 molecular
weight-based structural scales. For reaction tasks, we include 100 common reaction classes, 175
distinct reaction conditions, and 123 annotated reaction mechanisms. Together, these components
offer a rich and representative benchmark dataset for evaluating chemical reasoning in LLMs.
Chain-of-Thoughts Annotation for Modular Chemical Operations. To derive intermediate
reasoning steps for complex chemical problems, we distill the chain-of-thought annotations from
LLMs and arrange them as modular chemical operations for systematic evaluation and supervised
fine-tuning of reasoning models. Specifically, we analyze the problem-solving strategies of state-of-
the-art reasoning models, including Gemini-2.5-pro, DeepSeek-R1, and Claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking,
to extract step-wise reasoning patterns. These are distilled into a structured training corpus using
DeepSeek-R1 via CoT prompting. As illustrated in Fig. 3, our distilled CoT samples span key
chemical tasks including molecular understanding, editing, optimization, and reaction prediction.
3.3 Quality Review & Refinement
To ensure the high quality of our benchmark and its large-scale dataset, we performed iterative
evaluation and optimization of the molecules, results, and distilled Chain-of-Though reasoning
processes from DeepSeek-R1-0324 [ 13] in ChemCoTBench. Our hybrid assessment approach
combines automated LLM-based evaluation for scalability with manual expert review by chemists to
guarantee scientific rigor, enabling comprehensive dataset refinement while maintaining efficiency.
LLM-based CoT Evaluation. To improve the quality of CoT annotations in Deepseek’s process,
we focused on two key elements: (1) Task-Specific Prompt Design : We discovered that providing
detailed task descriptions and prior knowledge within prompts significantly enhances the model’s
performance on chemical tasks. (2) Incorporation of IUPAC name : We found that including IUPAC
names helps LLMs better understand complex molecular structures, as these names offer precise
details about functional groups. Leveraging these insights, we iteratively refined our prompt designs.
We then employed GPT-4o as an LLM verifier to ensure each CoT annotation was consistent with its
corresponding prompt template and the provided IUPAC names.

ing, and their correlated subtasks. For the functional-group counting task (FG) and ring counting
task (Ring) in the functional-group level molecule understanding, we apply the mean absolute er-
ror (MAE) as the evaluation metric. Tanimoto molecule similarity is applied as the evaluation for the
Murcko scaffold extraction task (Murcko). The accuracy (%) metric is applied to other subtasks.

understanding and editing tasks, while more challenging tasks like molecule optimization and reaction
prediction maintained over 90% accuracy (as shown in Fig. 2 (c)). Furthermore, we corrected these
errors to enhance ChemCoTBench’s quality.
4 Experiments
4.1 Evaluation Metrics
For understanding tasks, functional group (FG) and ring recognition are treated as counting problems,
with mean absolute error (MAE) used to measure precision. Scaffold-level understanding includes
extracting Murcko scaffolds, evaluated by Tanimoto similarity, and identifying whether complex ring
systems are present, evaluated by accuracy. The SMILES equivalence task is formulated as a binary
decision problem, determining whether the target and source SMILES represent the same molecule,
and is also evaluated using accuracy. For molecule editing, we use Pass@1 to assess whether the
edited molecule meets the instructions. Mechanism route selection is framed as a multiple-choice task
and evaluated by accuracy. Other reaction tasks are modeled as SMILES generation problems, where
evaluation is based on both Top-1 accuracy and fingerprint-based similarity (FTS), using Morgan [ 46],
MACCS [7], and RDKit [32] fingerprints to reflect correctness and structural similarity.
4.2 Evaluated LLMs
Our evaluation includes three model categories: (1) Reasoning LLMs with explicit step-by-step

reasoning capabilities. ∆is the mean property improvement, where a negative ∆indicates that most
optimizations are property degradations. SR% is the success rate that brings property increase.

4.3 LLMs’ Performance on Solving ChemCoTBench
We evaluated reasoning LLMs, their non-reasoning counterparts, and task-specific models [ 5,31,39]
on foundational (molecule understanding and editing, Table 1) and application (molecule optimization,
Table 2; reaction prediction, Table 3) tasks within ChemCoTBench. Key findings include:
Hierarchical Skill Transfer. Strong performance in foundational molecular understanding and edit-
ing tasks directly translates to success in complex application tasks. This validates ChemCoTBench’s
design, where fundamental chemical knowledge underpins advanced problem-solving. For example,
Claude-3.7-sonnet and Gemini-2.5-pro, top performers in foundational tasks (Table 1), also lead in
molecule optimization and reaction prediction.
Efficacy of Advanced Reasoning in Commercial LLMs: Commercial LLMs equipped with
sophisticated reasoning mechanisms (e.g., Deepseek-R1, o3-mini) significantly outperform their
non-reasoning counterparts on ChemCoTBench’s challenging applied tasks. In molecule optimization
(Table 2), Deepseek-R1 shows a >30% improvement over Deepseek-V3, and o3-mini gains >20%
over GPT-4o. Similar trends are observed for reaction prediction (Table 3). This suggests that RL-
honed "slow thinking" capabilities [ 40,48,62], when combined with sufficient domain knowledge,
enable superior abstraction and problem-solving beyond mere knowledge retrieval.

and Fwd by: by-product prediction), resynthesis prediction (Retro), reaction condition prediction (Con-
dition), and reaction mechanism prediction (NEPP: next element-step product prediction, MechSel:
reaction mechanism selection prediction). FTS: molecule fingerprint similarity with reference.

Unrealized Promise of Hybrid Thinking in Open-Source Models for Chemistry without Domain-
Specific Data: Current open-source models featuring hybrid thinking modes, such as Llama-3.3-
Nemotron [ 2] and Qwen3 [ 72], achieve substantial, often efficient, performance in general domains
like code and mathematics. However, their advanced reasoning capabilities, intended to be general,
do not effectively transfer to specialized scientific fields like chemistry. We attribute this shortfall to a
critical lack of domain-specific reasoning training data. Our empirical results are stark (Tables 1-3):
enabling the reasoning modes in these models yields no significant performance improvement on
chemical tasks compared to their non-reasoning counterparts. This finding strongly suggests that
general reasoning architectures require specialized data to adapt to new domains.
4.4 Evaluating Strategies to Enhance Chemical Reasoning in Open-Source LLMs
Our preceding analyses underscored the critical role of advanced reasoning capabilities (or "slow
thinking") for tackling complex chemical tasks. This motivates an investigation into efficient methods
for bolstering these capabilities within open-source LLMs.
Challenges in Distilling Chemical Reasoning: Distilling CoT capabilities from advanced LLMs
(e.g., using DeepSeek-R1-generated samples [ 13,71]) is a common strategy to enhance reasoning
in smaller models. However, this approach proves significantly limited for specialized chemical
reasoning. Our experiments (Fig.4) show that Qwen2.5-Instruct models distilled for CoT exhibit
little to no improvement on ChemCoTBench chemical subtasks compared to their non-distilled
counterparts; indeed, smaller base models (1.5B-32B) often perform comparably or better. While
effective for general domains like code and math (Fig.4), this distillation strategy falters in chemistry,
likely due to insufficient volume or specificity of chemical CoT samples in the distillation process,
hindering the development of robust step-by-step chemical reasoning. Moreover, smaller distilled
models (<7B) frequently produce lengthy, repetitive, and irrelevant (hallucinatory) thought processes.
These findings suggest that direct CoT distillation, without substantial domain-specific adaptation, is
an ineffective standalone method for improving chemical reasoning in open-source models.

against its DeepSeek-R1-distilled versions. The bottom row illustrates performance improvements in
Qwen-2.5-Instruct when enhanced with the CoT template and detailed CoT process.
Domain-Specific Chemical CoT Data Augmentation Boosts Reasoning: Given the limitations of
direct distillation, we explored enhancing chemical reasoning using our high-quality, domain-specific
ChemCoTDataset via prompting. This dataset was meticulously curated to minimize hallucinations
and align with expert thought processes, which we posited would be vital for chemical reasoning
tasks. We tested this by evaluating two CoT prompting strategies: one providing only coarse strategic
guidance (CoT templates), and another augmented with detailed step-by-step reasoning processes
from our dataset. The results in the bottom line of Fig. 4 consistently demonstrate that our large-scale
chemical CoT dataset significantly enhances the chemical reasoning capabilities of Qwen-2.5 models
across various scales (1.5B to 32B) when used in this way. Augmentation with detailed CoT processes
yielded stable and substantial performance gains across all evaluated tasks. Notably, while CoT
templates stably benefited small models (<14B), larger LLMs develop rigid code & math reasoning
templates that constrain their ability to effectively leverage the chemical patterns for performance
improvement. This highlights an interplay between model scale and the granularity of CoT guidance
required for optimal benefit.
5 Conclusion and Discussion
This paper introduces ChemCoTBench, a new chemical reasoning benchmark to evaluate the complex
chemical problem-solving ability of LLMs. Compared to existing Scientific benchmarks that focus
on simple knowledge retrieval, our ChemCoTBench establishes a step-by-step, application-oriented,
and high-quality benchmark by gathering samples from both foundational and applicational chemical
tasks, including molecule understanding, editing, optimization, and reaction prediction. Furthermore,
a 14k large chemical CoT dataset is also provided for enhancing chemical reasoning ability of
LLMs. Extensive experiments across 22 chemical tasks in ChemCoTBench demonstrate that current
open-source and distillation-based reasoning LLMs still have significant room for improvement in
complex chemical reasoning, while also validating the boosting effect of our large chemical CoT
dataset on chemical reasoning capabilities. ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between LLM reasoning
capabilities and real-world chemical problem-solving needs, offering researchers a standardized
9evaluation platform for complex chemical reasoning. Future works could continue with designing
policy optimization and distillation strategies to enhance the chemical reasoning capability of LLMs.
Chemical-aware reward mechanisms warrant further exploration. We also focus on extending
ChemCoTBench and its chemical CoT dataset to larger biochemical domains and scale.

A.1 LLM Chain-of-Thoughts.
The evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transitioned from basic text generation to
sophisticated reasoning systems, exemplified by [ 64] Chain-of-Thought methodology that facili-
tates systematic problem decomposition through deliberate cognitive paradigms. These advanced
reasoning architectures demonstrate exceptional proficiency in domains demanding structured ana-
lytical capabilities, particularly in mathematical computation and programming tasks. Benchmark
evaluations on MATH [ 19] and GSM8K [ 6] reveal significant achievements by models including
DeepSeek-R1 [13], Gemini [56], and Anthropic Claude.
LLM Reasoning on Multimodal Domain. With the rapid development of vision-language domain,
reasoning on images and videos are increasingly important [ 65]. Visual-RFT [ 35], VLM-R1 [ 49]
establish the visual chain-of-thoughts data construction pipeline and RL-based post-training strategies.
Vision-R1 [ 20] further propose the cold start strategy for better multimodal reasoning. In the 3D
domain, [ 9,52,68,70] apply chain-of-thoughts to point clouds and 3D objects to achieve LLM
reasoning.
LLM Reasoning on Chemical Domain. Emerging applications in chemical sciences demonstrate
LLM capabilities in spectra analysis [ 33], synthesis planning [ 4], and computational chemistry [ 26,
45,51]. Also, LLMs [ 41] show outstanding multi-task generalization ability on the molecule domain
and protein domain. However, current research lacks a comprehensive assessment of chemical
reasoning capacities encompassing spatial cognition, domain knowledge assimilation, and complex
logical inference processes.
B Data Construction Details
In this section, we propose the detailed information during our benchmark and dataset construction
process, including the data source description, dataset composition, filtering strategies, and the
1Table 4: The Dataset Statistics of ChemCoTBench and its Large CoT Dataset. We visualize
the sample numbers for every subtask in ChemCoTBench. The data distribution of molecule
understanding & editing, molecule optimization, and reaction prediction is nearly average.

rationale for dataset construction. In Table. 4, we also visualize the data distribution of subtasks in
ChemCoTBench.
B.1 Data Collection
The raw molecular structures used for understanding, editing, and optimization are obtained from sev-
eral published datasets, including PubChem [ 30], ChEMBL [ 11], ZINC [ 25], and Deep-Mol-Opt [ 18].
Chemical reaction data are separately collected from patent databases, including USPTO [ 21], Pista-
chio [ 42], and Reaxys [ 8]. For reaction mechanism annotation, we followed the processing pipeline
described in [28].
B.2 Dataset Composition and Filtering Strategies
Molecular Samples (25% of Benchmark): Although the ZINC database contains 250,000
molecules, we observed that its molecular weight distribution is relatively concentrated. To en-
sure diversity, we carefully selected molecules from PubChem, ChEMBL, and ZINC based on
molecular weight and structural complexity. This filtering process resulted in a smaller but more
representative molecular subset for our benchmark.
Molecular Optimization Pairs (38% of Benchmark): The Deep-Mol-Opt dataset provided 198,559
molecular pairs with property annotations. However, we excluded pairs with minimal property
improvement ( ∆< 0.3) or those containing complex polycyclic structures that might challenge LLM
comprehension. The remaining high-quality pairs were retained for molecular optimization tasks.
Chemical Reaction Samples (19% of Benchmark): Reaction equations (including reactants,
products, conditions, and catalysts) were sourced from USPTO, Pistachio, and Reaxys. To avoid
redundancy, we balanced the selection across these databases by reaction type and catalyst diversity.
For reaction mechanism annotation, we incorporated 275 manually curated examples from [ 28],
which were chosen for their high quality and balanced distribution.
B.3 Rationale for Task Construction
Molecular Understanding and Editing Tasks: Molecular understanding and editing tasks are
designed as closed-ended problems with deterministic answers. Since these tasks rely on well-defined
chemical properties and structures, we directly sampled molecules from PubChem, ChEMBL, and
ZINC as the source data. The corresponding ground-truth answers, including molecular properties
and SMILES transformations, are programmatically extracted using RDKit, ensuring accuracy and
reproducibility.
Molecular Optimization Task Design: Unlike fixed-answer tasks, molecular optimization is
inherently open-ended, where multiple valid optimization paths may exist for a given input molecule.
To construct this dataset, we considered two sampling strategies:
•Baseline Model-Generated Optimizations: Advantage : Enables sampling large-scale and multi-step
optimization paths for source molecules; Limitation : Existing models often fail to preserve scaffold
consistency, a critical requirement in drug design.
2•Predefined Molecular Pairs: Advantage : Ensures chemically meaningful transformations with
verified property improvements; Limitation : limited molecule samples.
To maintain the scaffold consistency, we adopt the second strategy for our ChemCoTBench, sourcing
molecular pairs from Deep-Mol-Opt [ 18]. We perform Murcko scaffold similarity analysis to validate
scaffold consistency, confirming that the selected pairs maintain structural integrity while optimizing
target properties.
Reaction Prediction Task Design: Reaction prediction is a cornerstone of chemical research and
industrial applications. From an academic standpoint, it is fundamental to understanding chemical
reactivity, discovering novel transformations, and advancing the design of new molecules. In practical
applications, accurate reaction prediction accelerates drug discovery, facilitates materials science
innovation, optimizes chemical manufacturing processes, and enables the automation of chemical
synthesis. Our benchmark aims to evaluate LLMs’ capabilities in this multifaceted domain rigorously.
•Forward Reaction Prediction : This task, pivotal for academic discovery and industrial applications
like drug development, evaluates an LLM’s ability to predict both major products and, uniquely in
our benchmark, byproducts from given reactants and reagents. Data is sourced from 100 distinct
reaction classes from Pistachio. To enhance difficulty and assess deeper reasoning, the reaction
type is deliberately omitted, requiring the model to first infer the plausible reaction type and then
deduce potential products, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of reaction outcomes
crucial for optimization.
•Retrosynthesis Prediction : Essential for planning the synthesis of novel compounds, this task
assesses an LLM’s understanding of reverse chemical logic, specifically its capacity to identify
strategic bond disconnections and propose valid precursor structures. We focus on single-step
retrosynthesis, considering multi-step planning a more complex hybrid task, to directly evaluate
core retrosynthetic reasoning. Data comprises 100 reaction classes from Pistachio, and problem
formulation includes providing reagents alongside the target product to help narrow the solution
space and guide the LLM towards chemically relevant disconnections.
•Reaction Condition Prediction : Predicting optimal reaction conditions (catalysts, solvents, reagents)
is critical for synthesis success, efficiency, and selectivity. This task tests an LLM’s knowledge of
how these components influence reaction pathways. Following Gao et al. [ 10] for data construction
from USPTO [ 36] (retaining reactions with at most one catalyst, two solvents, and two reagents),
we uniquely model this as a SMILES sequence generation task for catalyst, solvent, and reagent
prediction, offering a more rigorous challenge than simple MCQ formats by requiring specific
chemical structure (In SMILES) generation.
•Mechanism Prediction : Understanding reaction mechanisms—the step-by-step sequence of elemen-
tary reactions—is fundamental to chemistry, providing the "why" and "how" behind transformations
and enabling rational design and optimization. This task evaluates an LLM’s grasp of core mecha-
nistic principles such as electron flow, intermediate stability, bond-making/breaking sequences, and
the influence of conditions on pathways, addressing a significant gap in current LLM assessments,
which often treat reactions as black boxes. Inspired by prior works [ 27,28] but aiming for a more
holistic probe, we introduce two subtasks: "Next Elementary Step Product Prediction," where the
LLM, given a sequence of annotated elementary steps, predicts the subsequent product, testing
its ability to comprehend and extrapolate mechanistic progression; and "Reaction Mechanism
Selection (MCQ type)," where the LLM chooses the most plausible mechanism from several
alternatives for a given reaction (reactants, conditions, reagents), assessing its capacity to discern
how subtle changes in reagents or conditions dictate specific mechanistic routes, thereby evaluating
both sequential understanding and discriminative judgment of mechanistic pathways.
C Experimental Details
C.1 Hardware Requirements
The experimental workload was supported by a dedicated GPU cluster comprising three high-
performance computing nodes: an NVIDIA RTX A6000 (48GB VRAM) and an RTX 3090 (24GB
VRAM) for LLM API scheduling and deployment of smaller models (1.5B/7B parameters), comple-
mented by an NVIDIA A100 (80GB VRAM) node dedicated to large-scale LLM inference. This
3heterogeneous configuration achieved optimal resource allocation, with the A100’s tensor cores and
high-bandwidth memory handling memory-intensive model inferences while the A6000/3090 pair
efficiently managed concurrent API requests and lighter workloads. Storage requirements remained
modest at approximately 1GB, encompassing benchmark datasets (SMILES strings and annotations),
quantized model checkpoints, and evaluation logs, all hosted on an NVMe-backed filesystem for
rapid data access.
C.2 Evaluation Metrics
To comprehensively assess model performance, we employ the following metrics:
Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted outcomes, providing a baseline measure of overall
correctness. For reaction prediction tasks (e.g., forward reaction prediction), we choose the Top-1
accuracy, which specifically means the model’s highest-ranked prediction exactly matches the true
product(s).
Mean Absolute Error: Quantifies the average magnitude of errors in continuous predictions, offering
insight into precision for regression tasks (e.g., molecular property prediction).
Scaffold Similarity: Measured via the Tanimoto coefficient of molecular scaffolds, this evaluates
structural conservation between generated and reference molecules. Values range from 0 to 1,
representing scaffolds without similarity to correct scaffolds, with higher scores indicating better
preservation of core frameworks.
Improvement: Absolute gains in target properties, reported as: Mean improvement: Average
uplift across all samples. Max/min improvement: Extreme cases highlighting model potential and
limitations.
Success Rate: The fraction of generated molecules exceeding a predefined threshold (e.g., > 0.8 for
solubility), reflecting practical utility.
Validity: Measures the proportion of generated SMILES strings that are syntactically correct and can
be successfully parsed into a chemical structure by RDKit [32].
C.3 Count Distribution Analysis
Error Distribution for Ring Counting Task Error Distribution for Functional -Group Counting TaskAbsolute Error Per Sample
Absolute Error Per Sample
Figure 5: Error distribution analysis for ring counting and functional-group counting tasks.
For the two counting tasks under molecule understanding—ring counting and functional-group
counting—we evaluated model performance using the Mean Absolute Error in the main experimental
section to quantify overall accuracy. To provide a more granular analysis of LLMs’ capabilities in
these molecule-specific counting tasks, we further examined the error distribution across different
models.
As illustrated in Fig. 5, the ring counting task proves significantly more challenging than the functional-
group counting task. This is evident from the error distributions: For functional-group counting, the
majority of errors fall within the 0.0–1.0 range, indicating relatively high accuracy. In contrast, ring
counting exhibits higher errors, with most models (except Gemini-2.5-pro) showing an average MAE
> 1.0. Gemini-2.5-pro stands out as the only model achieving consistently low errors in this task,
suggesting superior structural reasoning capabilities. This disparity highlights the inherent difficulty
of ring counting, which requires precise identification of cyclic structures—a more complex task
4than detecting localized functional groups. The results underscore the need for further refinement of
LLMs in handling intricate molecular topologies.
D Case Study for Tasks in ChemCoTBench
To provide a more detailed analysis of the performance of different types of LLMs across various
tasks in ChemCoTBench, we supplement the quantitative findings in the Experiment section with
visualizations of model outputs. In the following three subsections, we present case visualizations
from distinct subtasks: molecule understanding, molecule editing, and molecule optimization.
Table 5: This is a case study for molecule understanding. We visualize the Murcko Scaffold generation
task in molecule understanding because it can provide detailed information compared to number
prediction tasks and correction distinguishing tasks.

D.1 Case Study for Molecule Understanding
The molecule understanding task in ChemCoTBench contains three types of subtasks, including
number prediction subtasks (functional-group counting and ring counting), distinguish subtasks (ring
system distinguish, SMILES consistency distinguish), and scaffold generation subtask (murcko
scaffold generation). To visualize the detailed molecule structure generated by different types of
LLMs, we select the Murcko scaffold generation subtask as the case visualization source.
Table. 5 presents four examples featuring distinct ring structures and functional groups. Through
comparative analysis, we identify two key advantages of commercial LLMs over smaller open-source
LLMs:
5Superior SMILES Parsing Accuracy. Commercial LLMs(e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) correctly interpret
molecular SMILES structures, with predicted structures closely matching the source molecules (only
1–2 bond position errors). In contrast, open-source models like LLaMA-3.1 generate structures
largely inconsistent with the source molecules.
Robust Instruction-Following for Murcko Scaffolds. When tasked with extracting Murcko
scaffolds—defined as the maximal connected framework retaining ring systems while removing
non-critical functional groups—commercial LLMs adhere to the provided instructions and generate
connected scaffolds. Llama-3.1, however, often outputs fragmented substructures, highlighting its
limitations in instruction comprehension.
D.2 Case Study for Molecule Editing
The molecule editing task in ChemCoTBench contains three parts: adding a target functional group
to the molecule, removing a target functional group from the molecule, and substituting a functional
group with a target functional group from the molecule. In Table. 6, we visualize samples from
each subtask with different types of target functional groups. Two key observations emerge from the
analysis:
Functional Group Recognition Directly Impacts Task Performance. Gemini-2.5-Pro demon-
strates high precision in functional group identification, enabling accurate molecular editing. While
Qwen3-235B correctly identifies functional groups, it frequently fails to execute valid molecular
modifications. LLaMA-3.1 struggles with basic functional group recognition, severely limiting its
task completion capability. This trend aligns with the models’ performance in the functional-group
counting subtask under molecule understanding, confirming a strong correlation between recognition
accuracy and downstream success.
2D Molecular Structure Parsing Poses a Significant Challenge. Due to the inherently linear nature
of SMILES notation, LLMs generally perform well on molecules with extended one-dimensional
chains. However, their accuracy declines sharply when processing complex polycyclic systems with
intricate 2D topologies.
D.3 Case Study for Molecule Optimization
Molecular Optimization Tasks involve improving three physicochemical properties (QED, Solubility,
LogP) and three protein-related activation capabilities (DRD2, JNK3, GSK3- β). Since large language
models perform poorly in optimizing protein-related activations, we focus on their ability to optimize
physicochemical properties. Table 3 presents the optimization results of three LLMs, including
Gemini-2.5-pro, Qwen3-235B, and llama3.3-70B, revealing two key observations:
LLMs exhibit significant potential in this task. Despite the inherent difficulty of molecular
optimization, LLMs exhibit significant potential in this task. We observed that these models introduce
diverse functional groups, including halogens, aldehydes, hydroxyls, and amines, indicating broad
chemical adaptability. However, some modifications led to negative optimization, likely due to limited
understanding of the underlying physicochemical principles—a gap that could be addressed through
targeted training.
Commercial LLMs demonstrate bolder optimization strategies compared to open-source models .
For instance, Gemini-2.5-pro frequently performs skeleton-level modifications (e.g., additions or
deletions), whereas Qwen3-235B and llama3.3 tend toward conservative insertions with minimal
structural changes. This contrast highlights the greater flexibility and potential of commercial LLMs
in molecular optimization.
6Table 6: The case study for functional-group addition, deletion, and substitution in the molecule
editing task. For better comparison, we visualize the predicted results from Gemini-2.5-pro (reasoning
LLM), Qwen3-235B (non-reasoning LLM), and llama3.3-70B (non-reasoning LLM) and show the
outstanding chemical reasoning ability of Gemini compared to other open-sourced LLMs.

molecule editing, molecule optimization, and reaction prediction. As illustrated in Figure. 6, Figure. 7,
Figure. 8, and Figure. 10, each figure presents sample cases from different tasks, with text highlighted
