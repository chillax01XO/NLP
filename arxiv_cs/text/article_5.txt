Fig. 1. Our method generates multi-subject images by leveraging the layout encoded in the initial noise. Having a layout control allows to accurately generate
each subject. We predict the layout based on the initial noise, and refine it throughout the denoising process, aligning it with the prompt and making it more
fine-grained. Using the layout encoded in the initial noise we preserve the prior of the original model and generate diverse compositions. Below each of the
generated images, we show the layout predicted at three timesteps along the generation process.
Generating multiple distinct subjects remains a challenge for existing text-
to-image diffusion models. Complex prompts often lead to subject leakage,
causing inaccuracies in quantities, attributes, and visual features. Preventing
leakage among subjects necessitates knowledge of each subject’s spatial
location. Recent methods provide these spatial locations via an external
layout control. However, enforcing such a prescribed layout often conflicts
with the innate layout dictated by the sampled initial noise, leading to
misalignment with the model’s prior. In this work, we introduce a new
approach that predicts a spatial layout aligned with the prompt, derived
from the initial noise, and refines it throughout the denoising process. By
relying on this noise-induced layout, we avoid conflicts with externally
imposed layouts and better preserve the model’s prior. Our method employs
a small neural network to predict and refine the evolving noise-induced
layout at each denoising step, ensuring clear boundaries between subjects
while maintaining consistency. Experimental results show that this noise-
aligned strategy achieves improved text-image alignment and more stable
multi-subject generation compared to existing layout-guided techniques,
while preserving the rich diversity of the model’s original distribution.
1 INTRODUCTION
Diffusion models have revolutionized the field of image synthesis,
enabling the creation of high-quality and diverse images from in-
tuitive conditions such as textual prompts. However, despite their
significant success, these models still struggle to accurately align
to complex prompts [Chefer et al .2023]. Specifically, generatingmultiple subjects remains surprisingly challenging, often resulting
in inaccurate quantities, attributes, and visual features [Binyamin
et al. 2024; Rassin et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2024].
Recent works have identified harmful leakage between subjects as
a primary source to text-image misalignment. To address this issue,
previous methods manipulate the denoising process by limiting
inter-attention among distinct subjects [Dahary et al .2025]. This
approach requires knowing each subject’s spatial location, which is
not explicitly represented within the model, and hence it relies on a
prescribed layout control.
However, an externally imposed layout [Feng et al .2024b,a; Qu
et al.2023; Yang et al .2024; Zheng et al .2023] can conflict with
the layout implied by the sampled initial noise, creating tension
with the model’s prior and potentially leading to inferior results or
deviations from the model’s prior.
Specifically, as the image’s low frequencies are defined early in
the denoising process, the initial noise plays a fundamental role in
shaping the final layout of the generated image [Ban et al .2024; Guo
et al.2024; Patashnik et al .2023]. Therefore, steering the denoising
trajectory toward a specific layout requires actively countering the
model’s intrinsic prior, which naturally encodes a layout intent
within the initial noise. This often pushes the generated image away
from the image manifold, resulting in semantic misalignment and
degradation of image quality.2 •Omer Dahary, Yehonathan Cohen, Or Patashnik, Kfir Aberman, and Daniel Cohen-Or

Fig. 2. Our method generates images with multiple subjects without requir-
ing external layout inputs. By following the innate noise-induced layout
encoded in the sampled initial noise, we preserve the model’s prior and
achieve diverse compositions. The second row show the initial noise-induced
layout of the corresponding output images above. As can be seen, the initial
layouts reflect the final composition of the generated images.
In this work, we introduce a method that derives a prompt-aligned
spatial layout from the initial noise and iteratively refines it through-
out the denoising process, as illustrated in Figure 1. By anchoring
the layout around the initial noise, this approach stays consistent
with the model’s prior, avoiding the conflicts introduced by exter-
nally imposed layouts. We argue that this approach promotes more
natural and diverse compositions by minimizing resistance to the
input noise, and hence succeeds in generating images that better
adhere to the prompt.
To produce the layout, we train a small neural network that
predicts the layout induced by the latent noisy image using fea-
tures extracted from the denoising model. This network is applied
throughout the denoising process, gradually refining the layout at
each timestep to guide the generation toward layouts that remain
both prompt-aligned and consistent across timesteps.
Our work embraces the motto “Be Decisive”. At each denoising
step, we guide the process toward a well-defined layout, ensuring
clear boundaries between subjects. In this approach, each subject is
assigned to a distinct image region, preventing leakage and enhanc-
ing text-image alignment. Meanwhile, only minimal adjustments
are made to the layout between steps, maintaining consistency with
the noise-induced layout throughout the process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate our method’s
power in adhering to complex multi-subject prompts, and compare
it with previous methods. Specifically, we demonstrate that our
method generates combinations of classes, adjectives, and quantities
while maintaining diverse layouts that are natural, as they remain
consistent with the model’s prior layouts. Figure 2 highlights this
diversity, showcasing compositions obtained by sampling different
initial noises.
2 RELATED WORK
Diffusion models [Dhariwal and Nichol 2021; Podell et al .2023;
Ramesh et al .2022; Rombach et al .2022; Saharia et al .2022] haveachieved remarkable success in modeling the complex distribution of
natural images. However, despite their advantages, these models still
face limitations in adhering to detailed prompts, particularly those
involving multiple subjects. Previous works have addressed chal-
lenges in multi-subject generation through two distinct approaches:
conditioning the generation on a spatial layout or applying heuris-
tics to attention maps to enforce the generation of each subject
mentioned in the prompt.
Layout-Based Multi-Subject Generation. Layout-based methods
have demonstrated greater consistency in multi-subject generation
compared to text-to-image models. Early efforts incorporated layout
information through techniques such as multiple diffusion compo-
sitions [Bar-Tal et al .2023; Ge et al .2023], guidance from model
features [Kim et al .2022; Luo et al .2024; Voynov et al .2023], specif-
ically attention features [Chen et al .2023a; Couairon et al .2023;
Kim et al .2023; Liu et al .2023; Phung et al .2024; Xie et al .2023],
or fine-tuning [Avrahami et al .2023; Li et al .2023b; Nie et al .2024;
Yang et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2023b].
Recent studies highlight the architectural tendency of attention
layers to leak visual features between subjects – a phenomenon
that complicates multi-subject generation [Dahary et al .2025]. To
address this, prior methods [Dahary et al .2025; Wang et al .2024a,b;
Zhou et al .2024] introduce techniques that mitigate such leakage
by modifying the operation of attention layers within the model.
However, these approaches rely on a predefined spatial layout to
identify the subjects among which leakage should be prevented. In
our work, we propose a method to dynamically define the spatial
locations of subjects during image generation by extracting the
layout throughout the process. This extracted layout is then used to
prevent leakage, enabling the generation of accurate multi-subjects
images.
To simplify the image generation process for users, a common
practice is to automatically generate a layout prior to image gen-
eration. Several works leverage large language models (LLMs) for
this task, employing in-context learning or chain-of-thought rea-
soning [Chen et al .2023b; Feng et al .2024b; Lian et al .2023; Qu et al .
2023; Yang et al .2024]. While these methods excel in producing
plausible layouts, the separation between the prompt-to-layout and
layout-to-image models often leads to inaccuracies or unnatural
results in multi-subject images. Notably, Ranni [Feng et al .2024a]
proposes overcoming this limitation by jointly fine-tuning the LLM
and diffusion model on a shared dataset. However, their approach
demands significant resources, with results obtained using a large
proprietary model trained on millions of examples.
Layout-Free Multi-Subject Generation. Numerous approaches have
sought to address specific aspects of subject misalignment during
inference without relying on a predefined spatial layout. Some ma-
nipulate text embeddings [Feng et al .2022; Tunanyan et al .2023],
while others guide the model to disentangle the attention distribu-
tions of distinct subjects and attributes [Agarwal et al .2023; Chefer
et al.2023; Li et al .2023a; Meral et al .2024; Rassin et al .2023]. While
these methods show some success, their effectiveness often hinges
on the initial noise, resulting in unstable outcomes. To enhance
robustness, other techniques [Bao et al .2024; Wang et al .2023]
employ fine-tuning based on similar heuristics in a self-supervisedBe Decisive: Noise-Induced Layouts for Multi-Subject Generation •3

manner. Nevertheless, due to the model’s limitations in interpreting
quantities and distinguishing between numerous subjects, these ap-
proaches often struggle to generate more than two or three distinct
subjects and fail to support multiple instances of the same class
effectively.
Other works specifically tailor solutions for accurate subject quan-
tities [Binyamin et al .2024; Kang et al .2023; Zhang et al .2023a].
While these methods perform well for single-class scenarios, they
lack the generality needed for complex compositions involving
multi-class subjects and attributes. In contrast, our approach pro-
vides comprehensive control over multi-class subjects, quantities,
and attributes, addressing the limitations of existing layout-free
methods.
3 PRELIMINARY: BOUNDED ATTENTION
Text-to-image diffusion models struggle to generate accurate multi-
subject images due to visual leakage between subjects. Prior work [Da-
hary et al .2025] identified the model’s attention layers as the pri-
mary source of this leakage — where features of semantically similar
subjects are indiscriminately blended — and proposed Bounded At-
tention as a training-free solution to mitigate it.
Given an input layout, Bounded Attention modifies the atten-
tion layers during the denoising process by masking the attention
between queries and keys of different subjects. In cross-attention
layers, it constrains each subject’s attention to its corresponding
textual tokens. In self-attention layers, it restricts attention to pixels
within the subject’s own region and the background, explicitly ex-
cluding other subjects. This masking scheme reduces the influence
of irrelevant visual and textual tokens on each pixel, maintaining
the distinct visual features of each subject.
During generation, Bounded Attention alternates between de-
noising steps and guidance steps, both of which adopt the maskingscheme. In guidance mode, the latent representation is optimized to
adhere to the input layout: 𝑧opt

, where
LcrossandLselfare loss terms that encourage the respective cross-
and self-attention maps to focus within each subject’s designated
mask. By isolating attention for each subject, the masking scheme
avoids guidance artifacts caused by forcing similar queries to di-
verge, maintaining a trajectory that is better aligned with the data
manifold.
In our work, we adopt Bounded Attention’s masking scheme to
reduce leakage, but instead of relying on a prescribed layout, we
extract the noise-induced layout and refine it between denoising
steps. We further modify the guidance procedure to promote deci-
siveness — that is, enforcing strict subject boundaries throughout
the layout refinement process.
4 METHOD
Our method aims to facilitate the generation of multiple distinct
subjects using an existing text-to-image model [Podell et al .2023].
We steer the denoising process to adhere to a layout that allows
preventing unwanted leakage among the subjects. Our key idea is
to progressively define a prompt-aligned spatial layout based on
features extracted from the noisy latent images along the denoising
process. We then encourage the denoising process to follow these
layouts, upholding this initial “decision”.
Figure 3 illustrates the overall structure of our inference pipeline.
Our method is built on a denoising process to which we apply
Bounded Attention [Dahary et al .2025] (marked in orange boxes)
controlled by layout masks 𝑀𝑡. We add two components to the de-
noising process. First, a component that predicts a prompt-aligned
layout 𝑀𝑡from a noisy latent image 𝑧𝑡based on features extracted
from the diffusion model (purple box). Second, a guidance mecha-
nism that optimizes a noisy latent image so that its induced layout4 •Omer Dahary, Yehonathan Cohen, Or Patashnik, Kfir Aberman, and Daniel Cohen-Or
aligns with the previous layout (turquoise box). This mechanism
encourages a “decisive” generation process, where each subject men-
tioned in the prompt is consistently assigned to its own distinct
image region across timesteps.
Both components rely on a soft-layout 𝑆𝑡. The soft-layout is a
timestep-dependent feature map that reflects the likelihood that two
pixels will be associated with a common subject. In the following,
we elaborate on the soft-layout and its use.
4.1 Soft-Layout
We begin by explaining the motivation behind our soft-layouts.
Extracting fine-grained layouts directly from the initial noise is in-
herently challenging since the image is formed in a gradual manner.
Moreover, predicted layouts might not perfectly correspond to the
subjects specified in the prompt. To address these challenges, we
introduce the notion of soft-layout, a feature map that represents
each pixel as a descriptor encapsulating its potential to associate
with other pixels in composing a single subject. In the first timesteps,
due to high uncertainty, the soft-layout encodes a coarse layout. At
later timesteps, the soft-layout is more granular and precise. Our
use of the soft-layout is two-fold. First, it is used to predict the
masks 𝑀𝑡, termed as hard-layout , which bounds the attention in
the denoising steps. Second, we optimize the noisy latent image to
produce a soft-layout that agrees with 𝑀𝑡.
At the top of Figure 4, we display the progressive layouts pro-
duced by our full pipeline. In the middle, we show the correspond-
ing layouts without guidance. As illustrated, guidance is crucial
for maintaining consistent hard-layouts across timesteps, thereby
facilitating convergence to a prompt-aligned layout by the end of
the denoising process.
We now turn to formally define the soft-layout and elaborate on
the network we train to predict it. A soft-layout 𝑆𝑡∈R𝑛×𝑑is a
feature map, encoding 𝑛pixels as 𝑑-dimensional vectors, where the
similarity of two feature vectors 𝑆𝑡[𝑥1], 𝑆𝑡[𝑥2]indicates correspon-
dence to the same subject in the generated image. To produce the
soft-layout, we train a network that takes as input a set of features
extracted from various layers of the diffusion model.
Dataset. To train our network, we automatically construct a small
dataset of∼1500 images synthesized by the diffusion model, along
with their segmentation maps. First, we randomly generate a set of
prompts specifying multiple subject classes and their quantities (see
full details in the supplemental). Then, we synthesize images based
on these prompts, and segment them by feeding the corresponding
subject names to GroundedSAM [Ren et al .2024b]. We filter out
ambiguous examples, where two segmentation masks share a large
overlap, and select a single label for each segment based on the
segmentation model’s confidence score.
Notably, we do not apply any filtering based on prompt align-
ment. This allows the network to predict soft-layouts that match the
diffusion model’s intent, even if it does not adhere to the prompt. In
turn, this enables our guidance mechanism to detect misalignments
early in the denoising process and apply corrective updates to the
latent.“Aparrot andtwo doves sitting on a branch in a lush forest at daylight”

presents our method without guidance. The bottom row shows vanilla SDXL,
where only the soft-layout extracted from the noisy latents is displayed.
Below each image, we show the hard-layout obtained at the final timestep.
Architecture. Following Readout Guidance [Luo et al .2024], we
design our model as a collection of lightweight convolutional heads,
each processing different features from the denoising model along
with the current time embedding. The outputs of these heads are
then averaged using learnable weights, and fed into a convolutional
bottleneck head, which outputs a 64×64×10feature map, repre-
senting the soft-layout.
We attach our heads to the attention layers, which are known
to be highly indicative of the image structure and subject bound-
aries [Hertz et al .2022; Patashnik et al .2023; Tumanyan et al .2023].
Specifically, we use the cross-attention queries and the self-attention
keys at the decoder layers. See the supplemental for full architectural
details.
Training. We train the soft-layout network with a triplet loss
[Schroff et al .2015], encouraging feature similarity between pixels
of the same segment, and dissimilarity between different segments.

4.2 From Soft to Hard Layouts
While the soft-layout represents the original model’s future intent,
to successfully generate multiple prompt-aligned subjects, it is neces-
sary to uphold clear subject boundaries in accordance to the prompt.
To achieve this, we derive a hard-layout from the soft-layout pro-
duced by our network.
More specifically, given 𝑘subjects mentioned in the prompt, we
apply K-Means to cluster the soft-layout into 𝑘+1segments: 𝑘for
the subjects, and one for the background. We set the background 𝑀0
as the cluster that has the biggest overlap with the image’s border,
and recursively cluster each of the other segments into two sub-
clusters, continuing the process with the bigger sub-cluster, until
the variance is smaller than 𝜎2
cluster. Any sub-cluster dropped during
this process is added to 𝑀0.
Finally, we must tag each subject cluster with an appropriate label
representing a specific subject instance. After the first denoising
step, at 𝑡=𝑇, we compute the average cross-attention map of
each subject noun [Epstein et al .2023; Hertz et al .2022; Patashnik
et al.2023] and use the Hungarian algorithm to assign instances
to clusters such that the corresponding cross-attention response in
each cluster is maximized.
To avoid leakage, our initial decision regarding each subject’s
location must be respected throughout the generation process. Thus,
for𝑡<𝑇, we stack the soft-layout 𝑆𝑡with the previous soft-layouts
𝑆𝑡+1, . . . , 𝑆min(𝑡+𝑤,𝑇)from 𝑤earlier timesteps, before performing
hard-clustering. Since clusters may shift over time, we reassign their
labels at each timestep using the Hungarian algorithm, matching
each cluster in 𝑀𝑡to a cluster in 𝑀𝑡+1such that their intersection-
over-union (IoU) is maximized.
4.3 Decisive Guidance
To encourage decisiveness — in the sense of maintaining consistent
subject boundaries throughout generation — we perform guidance
steps after each denoising step. These steps optimize the interme-
diate latent 𝑧𝑡−1to align the predicted soft-layout 𝑆𝑡−1with the
previous hard-layout 𝑀𝑡(see turquoise box in Figure 3).
First, to integrate each subject’s semantics to its designated seg-
ment in 𝑀𝑡, we apply the cross-attention loss Lcrossfrom BoundedAttention (see Section 3). Notably, Bounded Attention also intro-
duces a self-attention loss Lselfto mitigate subject neglect in fixed,
externally provided layouts by discouraging background attention.
However, we omit this term, as it is unnecessary with our noise-
induced layouts and its removal significantly reduces runtime.
Nonetheless, our evolving layouts give rise to two distinct failure
modes. These are illustrated in Figure 5, which presents zoomed-
in views of the soft- and hard-layouts generated without guidance
(originally shown in Figure 4). On the left (Figure 5a), the soft-layout
contains three spatially separated foreground regions (colored green,
purple, and dark red) within a single hard-cluster, each correspond-
ing to a distinct dove. On the right (Figure 5b), the middle dove is
generated at the intersection of three hard-clusters and does not
maintain consistent membership in any single cluster during de-
noising. As a result, its lower body is initially assigned to the parrot
cluster, leading to a hybrid generation in which the dove inherits a
parrot-like tail.
To address the first issue (Figure 5a), we introduce a variance loss
Lvarthat encourages low cluster variance in 𝑆𝑡−1with respect to
the previous hard-layout 𝑀𝑡:
Lvar=1

This loss promotes intra-cluster similarity, encouraging each cluster
to represent a coherent subject instance.
To avoid cluster boundaries from oscillating between timesteps
(Figure 5b), we compute the Dice segmentation loss Ldice[Milletari
et al.2016] between the hard-layout 𝑀𝑡and a probabilistic layout
𝑃𝑡−1∈R𝑛×(𝑘+1), where each element 𝑃𝑡−1[𝑥𝑖, 𝑗]represents the
probability that pixel 𝑥𝑖belongs to cluster 𝑗:

where 𝜏is a temperature hyperparameter. This term penalizes am-
biguous pixel-cluster associations, promoting sharper and more
consistent cluster boundaries.
Together, these three terms address complementary aspects of
the layout refinement process: Lcrosspromotes the proper semantic
alignment in each cluster, Lvarreduces intra-cluster ambiguity, and
Ldiceencourages temporal consistency and boundary sharpness.
The final decisiveness loss is defined as:

where 𝛼cross, 𝛼var, 𝛼diceare the respective weighting coefficients.

iments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. We compare6 •Omer Dahary, Yehonathan Cohen, Or Patashnik, Kfir Aberman, and Daniel Cohen-Or

and-Excite (A&E) [Chefer et al .2023], and Bounded Attention (BA)
[Dahary et al .2025]. Since BA operates on layouts, we use an LLM
to automatically provide it with layouts constructed from given
prompts (denoted as LLM+BA). Furthermore, we include compar-
isons with LMD+[Lian et al .2023] and Ranni [Feng et al .2024a],
which require training.
5.1 Qualitative Results
Layout diversity. We begin our experiments by showing the ef-
fectiveness of our method in generating diverse and natural layouts
that adhere to the prompt. Each row of figures 6,10 depict images
generated from a single prompt using different random seeds. As
can be seen, our results exactly match subject descriptions, display-
ing proper combinations of classes, attributes and quantities, while
still demonstrating unique and believable compositions.
Non-curated results. We conduct a non-curated comparison with
our baseline in Figure 11 by sampling each method seven times,
using a single prompt and the seeds 0to6. We also display the
results obtained by Flux.
While LLM+BA is able to generate correct images four out of
seven times, our method is able to correctly adhere to the prompt
in each image without requiring an input layout. Notably, none of
the other methods, including Flux, are able to generate even one
sample that match the prompt, often depicting subject amalgama-
tions due to severe leakage. Specifically, SDXL, LLM+BA and A&E
suffer from over-generation of subjects, while Flux, RPG and Ranni
struggle due to under-generation. On the other hand, LMD+ is able
to construct the correct quantities, but is prone to generating un-
natural compositions, where subjects appear disjointed from the
background.
Multiple Personalized Subjects. Leakage between subjects is partic-
ularly noticeable when generating personalized subjects. Here, we
show that our method can be seamlessly integrated with an existing“... in the snow” “... in the snow” “... in a video game”

sonalized subjects. Specifically, we utilize a method trained to gen-
erate specific individuals by injecting personalized features through
the cross-attention layers of a text-to-image model [Patashnik et al .
2025]. This method does not inherently support the generation of
two individuals, as demonstrated in Figure 7. However, combining
this method with ours, enables the accurate generation of diverse
images with multiple individuals.
Comparisons with baselines. We present a qualitative comparison
in Figure 8. All other methods struggle to generate multi-subjects
prompts due to leakage. In the first row, none of the competing
methods are able to generate the distinct characteristics of each
of the bears. In the second row, they either generate the wrong
number of subjects, or leak the colors of the carpet or the cars into
the teddy bears. Specifically, the current LLM-based methods exhibit
either subpar control over subject quantities (LLM+BA, RPG, Ranni),
or unnatural grid-like subject arrangements (LLM+BA, LMD+). In
comparison, our method successfully generates prompt-aligned
images with natural-looking compositions.
5.2 Quantitative Results
Dataset evaluation. We perform quantitative evaluation on the
T2I-CompBench dataset [Huang et al .2023], assessing our method’s
performance across the following key aspects: multi-class composi-
tions, attribute binding, and numeracy. We further measure layout
diversity, which quantifies the variability of generated compositions
across different seeds. We summarize the results in Figure 9, and
refer to the supplement for the full table.Be Decisive: Noise-Induced Layouts for Multi-Subject Generation •7

trade-offs between metrics, our method consistently achieves high scores

To measure layout diversity, we sample 20 random prompts from
CompBench’s single-class dataset and generate five images per
prompt using five random seeds. We align all five layouts by maxi-
mizing the IoUbetween them using the Hungarian algorithm. Di-
versity is quantified as the average 1−IoUbetween all layout pairs
of the same prompt. As reported, our method achieves significantly
higher diversity than the baseline, preserving the innate variability
of the model’s prior, in contrast to the limited diversity of LLM-based
methods.
All other metrics were assessed on 200 prompts, sampled from the
respective category in CompBench. Color and texture binding was
evaluated using BLIP-VQA [Huang et al .2023], while single-class
and multi-class compositions were evaluated using the F1 scores
between ground-truth subject quantities and the quantities com-
puted by GroundedSAM [Ren et al .2024a] on the generated images.Table 1. User study results.

While other methods are tailored towards enhancing specific met-
rics, our approach consistently achieves high performance across
all measurements, surpassing competitors in most cases.
Lastly, since MIC is limited to single-class prompts, we only mea-
sure its performance on this specific metric. Our method achieves a
score of 0.837, compared to MIC’s score of 0.772.
User study. The automatic metrics in Figure 9 fail to detect seman-
tic leakage, as they rely on models trained on real images, where
such issues do not arise. To address this limitation, we conduct a user
study. We utilize ChatGPT to generate 25 prompts enlisting three
to four visually similar, but distinct, animals, with an appropriate
background. For each prompt, participants were shown 10 images:
five generated by our method, and five generated by a competing
method. Users were than tasked with selecting images with realis-
tic compositions that accurately reflect the prompt. For evaluation
against MIC, we additionally generate five prompts with single-class
quantities. We collected 192 responses from 32 participants. Table 1
reports the conditional probability of a selected image being gener-
ated by our method versus competitors. The results showcase our
method’s superiority in handling complex multi-subject prompts,
with our scores substantially improving over layout-based methods.
Notably, even though MIC is specifically designed to tackle single-
class quantities, our method receives comparable scores, while still
being versatile enough to support more complex prompts.
6 CONCLUSIONS
We have addressed the notorious difficulty of generating multiple
distinct subjects from complex prompts in text-to-image diffusion
models. Recognizing that inter-subject leakage is the primary issue,8 •Omer Dahary, Yehonathan Cohen, Or Patashnik, Kfir Aberman, and Daniel Cohen-Or
and that bounding mutual attention offers a viable solution, we de-
signed a mechanism to define a layout for controlling inter-subject
attention. Our key contribution lies in using the natural latent layout
defined by the initial noise of the model, rather than imposing an
external layout. By making only small adjustments on-the-fly, our
approach remains rooted in the original distribution of the model,
benefiting from denoising a signal already close to that distribu-
tion. Empirical evaluations confirm that this strategy provides a
stronger balance between text-image alignment and visual diversity
compared to layout-driven alternatives.
It is important to recognize that the multi-subject generation
problem is intrinsically tied to the pretrained model’s prior. When
the underlying network has not been sufficiently exposed to images
featuring multiple distinct subjects, its learned distribution may be
ill-equipped to handle complex multi-subject arrangements. As a
result, any approach aiming to improve multi-subject generation,
ours included, must contend with these fundamental distributional
constraints. Although our method outperforms existing alterna-
tives, there remains a ceiling imposed by the model training data,
restricting how effectively multi-subject prompts can be addressed
in practice.
The main limitation of our method lies in the computational cost
of the iterative guidance and its tendency to push the optimized
latent away from the prior distribution. In the future, we aim to
explore regularization techniques to keep the latent closer to its
original distribution or replace the optimization process with feature
injection from a control map representing the target clusters.

APPENDIX
A TECHNICAL DETAILS
A.1 Architecture and Hyperparameters
In our experiments, we used SDXL [Podell et al .2023] as the back-
bone model.
Our soft-layout network follows the Readout Guidance archi-
tecture with spatially aligned heads [Luo et al .2024], with minor
modifications:
•We use the self-attention keys and cross-attention queries
from the decoder layers as inputs to the network, adjusting
the input channels accordingly.
•We modify the final convolutional layer to output 10 chan-
nels instead of 3.
The network was trained for 5,000 steps using a learning rate
of10−4. To compute the triplet loss, we sample 50 pixel triplets
per image, selecting subject pixels with a probability of 0.75 and
background pixels with a probability of 0.25. A similarity margin of
𝛼=0.5is applied.
During image generation, we use 50 denoising steps, a DDPM
scheduler, and a guidance scale of 7.5. Guidance is applied during
the first 15 denoising steps, with 5 gradient descent iterations per
step. The decisive loss is computed using the weights 𝛼cross=0.3,
𝛼var=0.21, and 𝛼dice=0.49. ForLdice, a temperature value of
𝜏=15is used. For hard-clustering, we set a sliding window size of
𝑤=30and a variance threshold of 𝜎2
cluster=0.025.
A.2 Dataset Generation
Our dataset consists of approximately 1,500 generated images and
their corresponding segmentation maps.
To construct training prompts, we use the same 20 MSCOCO
classes as in MIC [Binyamin et al .2024]. Each prompt randomly
includes 1–3 classes. For each selected class, we assign a quantity
between 1 and 10, with a probability of 0.9. We optionally prepend
a prefix (with probability 0.8) and append a postfix (with probability
0.6), both sampled from fixed lists:
•Prefixes: “a photo of”, “an image of”, “a picture of”, “a paint-
ing of”.
•Postfixes: “on the grass”, “on the road”, “on the ground”, “in
a yard”.
We observe that our soft-layout network generalizes well to un-
seen object classes, backgrounds, and prompt structures, owing to
its lightweight design and the use of expressive attention features
from the pre-trained diffusion model.
A.3 Computational Resource Usage
All experiments were conducted on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, with all
computations — including clustering — performed on the GPU. Sim-
ilar to Readout Guidance, our sampling process takes approximately
77 seconds and utilizes 36 GB of VRAM, compared to 7 seconds and
8 GB for vanilla SDXL. Our implementation builds upon the Read-
out Guidance and Bounded Attention codebases, which were not
optimized for resource efficiency. As such, further code optimization
is likely to reduce both runtime and memory usage.Table 2. Quantitative evaluation.

B ADDITIONAL RESULTS
We use the same baseline as in the main paper: LLM+BA [Da-
hary et al .2025], RPG [Yang et al .2024], Ranni [Feng et al .2024a],
LMD+[Lian et al. 2023], and A&E [Chefer et al. 2023].
B.1 Quantitative Results
Table 2 presents the quantitative results comparing our method
with the baseline. Unlike other approaches that balance trade-offs
between metrics, our method consistently delivers high performance
across all metrics.
B.2 Qualitative Results
Figure 12 showcases additional qualitative comparison results. Un-
like competing methods, which fail to accurately generate all sub-
jects from the prompt, our method consistently preserves the in-
tended semantics of each subject. For instance, in the first row, none
of the methods successfully generate all the fruits specified in the
prompt. Similarly, in the last row, none of the methods accurately
capture all the animals in the prompt, with most suffering from
attribute leakage.
B.3 Ablation Studies
Quantitative Evaluation. To quantitatively assess the contribution
of each component, we conducted a user study, following the same
format as our benchmark user study, and composed of a subset of 10
random prompts from the full user study. We report the percentage
of user-selected images for each methods, i.e. prompt-alignment
accuracy, as recorded by 19 participants, in Table 3.
Qualitative Evaluation. We display qualitative ablation studies in
Figure 13, where we systematically vary our method’s configuration
to assess each component’s importance.

due to the instability of the hard-layouts during generation. Omit-
tingLcross orLvarcauses clusters to fragment internally, leading
them to span multiple, disconnected subject instances. Additionally,
parts of a subject may be absorbed into the background, resulting
in shrunken or incomplete subject regions. Omitting Ldicealso
promotes over-generation, as oscillating cluster boundaries across
timesteps lead to the emergence of redundant subjects with mixed
appearances at cluster edges.
Finally, we ablate the choice of computing our Ldecisive loss be-
tween the intermediate soft-layout 𝑆𝑡−1and the previous hard-
layout 𝑀𝑡. Instead, we apply an additional denoising step on 𝑧𝑡−1
before optimizing it using guidance. That denoising step is employed
to extract the denoising model’s features and compute an updatedhard-layout 𝑀𝑡−1. Then, during guidance, we compute Ldecisive
between 𝑆𝑡−1and𝑀𝑡−1. As evident in the second-to-right column,
this approach also compromises accurate subject generation, yield-
ing redundant subject instance due to clustering inconsistencies
between timesteps.
B.4 Limitations
In Figure 14, we present two limitations of our method. First, in
cluttered scenes, subjects may appear with irregular sizes or exhibit
poor interaction with the background (left image). We observe that
this issue also occurs with vanilla SDXL and can often be mitigated
by increasing the number of denoising steps.14 •Omer Dahary, Yehonathan Cohen, Or Patashnik, Kfir Aberman, and Daniel Cohen-Or

same timestep (instead of Ldecisive 𝑆𝑡−1, 𝑀𝑡). All images in each row are generated using the same seed.
“... acactus in aclay pot and

Fig. 14. Limitations.Second, since the layouts are derived from the model’s prior —
which lacks a robust understanding of spatial relationships [Chat-
terjee et al .2024] — subjects may sometimes fail to respect spatial
constraints specified in the prompt (right image).
