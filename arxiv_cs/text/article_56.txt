Abstract. To construct responsible and secure AI applications, harmful
information data is widely utilized for adversarial testing and the devel-
opment of safeguards. Existing studies mainly leverage Large Language
Models (LLMs) to synthesize data to obtain high-quality task datasets
at scale, thereby avoiding costly human annotation. However, limited by
the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs, the synthesis of harmful data
stillfaceschallengesingenerationreliabilityandcontentdiversity.Inthis
study, we propose a novel harmful information synthesis framework, Poi-
sonSwarm, which applies the model crowdsourcing strategy to generate
diverse harmful data while maintaining a high success rate. Specifically,
we generate abundant benign data as the based templates in a counter-
factual manner. Subsequently, we decompose each based template into
multiple semantic units and perform unit-by-unit toxification and final
refinement through dynamic model switching, thus ensuring the suc-
cess of synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that PoisonSwarm
achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing different categories

1 Introduction
Harmfulinformation[13],includingmisinformation,disinformation,hatespeech,
and offensive content, can have significantly negative impacts on individuals and
society. To prevent the widespread propagation of harmful information in online
environments, people have increasingly focused on collecting the corresponding
data to develop dedicated detection systems [15] or to strengthen the adversarial
robustness of AI products [21] against such harmful information.
The construction of a harmful information dataset via manual collection [9]
involves labor-intensive efforts to curate and annotate data from social media,

Data synthesis (right-bottom) generates abundant and diverse data by utilizing
LLMs’ world knowledge. We decompose such harmful tasks and introduce the
model crowdsourcing strategy to ensure the data diversity and success of gener-
ation for highly toxic data, e.g., phishing tweets.
thus ensuring the effectiveness of safeguards in real-world scenarios. While con-
sidering the temporal delay and data sparsity in collection, it is challenging to
construct a high-quality harmful information dataset that comprehensively re-
flectsemergingthreats.Additionally,theclassimbalanceanddatascarcityissues
[8] significantly limit the effectiveness of raw manual datasets, particularly when
usedforadversarialtestingondomain-specificharmfulcontent,e.g.,extremistor
terrorist speech. To overcome these limitations, data augmentation [10] and data
synthesizing [8] methods offer a scalable solution by generating simulated harm-
ful data through Large Language Models (LLMs). Although advanced aligned
LLMs are often prevented from generating harmful content from scratch due to
jailbreak concerns [21], they can still be used to expand seed data at scale in
data augmentation manners, such as template mutating [17], paraphrasing [10],
and sentiment adjustment [8]. However, such methods tend to generate homo-
geneous and low-toxic data [1], leading to decreased diversity as the expanded
dataset grows. In contrast, data synthesis methods enable LLMs to leverage
world knowledge for diverse harmful data generation, capturing the threats of
simulated human harmful behaviors and AI-driven harmful speech campaigns
[13], while heavily relying on jailbreak attack techniques. Given the instability
of such jailbreak attacks [17], especially when targeting advanced aligned LLMs,
existing data synthesis methods often struggle to benefit from the improvements
in LLMs, limiting their ability to distill diverse, high-quality data.
To alleviate this problem, we decouple risky operations from the use of strong
LLMs through a strong-weak LLM collaboration framework. Specifically, as il-
lustrated in Fig.1(c), the task of polishing tweet synthesis is decomposed intoPoisonSwarm: Universal Harmful Information Synthesis 3
multiple sub-tasks, each assigned to a specific LLM. When a malfunction oc-
curs, a weaker LLM dynamically replaces the faulty LLM for that sub-task (e.g.,
GPT-4o →Qwen-2.5-7B). By such dynamic switching, this framework can ulti-
mately minimize failures of harmful data synthesis from individual malfunctions
while leveraging the capabilities of advanced LLMs for high-quality generation.
Building on the strong-weak model collaboration framework, we propose
PoisonSwarm , a novel approach for robustly synthesizing diverse harmful data
through model crowdsourcing. In PoisonSwarm, LLMs collaborate to generate
abundant benign data and progressively toxify it, thus creating diverse harmful
data while maintaining a high success rate. Specifically, we first employ counter-
factual methods to generate benign content that has the desired structure and
thematic backbone. This benign content is then decomposed into smaller seman-
tic units, each of which is assigned to different LLMs for toxicification. If a unit
produces invalid results or malfunctions, PoisonSwarm dynamically switches to
another LLM to continue the toxification process. Finally, all toxicified content
is integrated and refined into high-quality harmful data. Experimental results
demonstrate that PoisonSwarm outperforms existing methods across multiple
evaluation metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in generating diverse and reli-
able harmful data. Our major contributions are:
–This study reveals the risks associated with harmful information generation
accompanied by the rapid development of strong LLMs. To evade strong
LLMs’ safety alignment mechanisms, this study introduces a strong-weak
LLM collaboration framework, where weak LLMs handle risky operations
guided by strong LLMs to synthesize high-quality harmful information.
–This study proposes the universal harmful information synthesis approach
PosionSwarm, which generates abundant benign data as the based templates
and toxicifies them via crowdsourcing them to multiple LLMs, thus handling
the challenge of content diversity and generation reliability.
–Experimental results demonstrate that PoisonSwarm outperforms existing
methodsinharmfulinformationsynthesisacrossmultipleevaluationmetrics,
highlighting its effectiveness in generating diverse and high-quality harmful
data for adversarial training and testing, thereby enhancing AI security.
2 Related Work
–Harmful Information Generation is utilized to augment the training
effectiveness of harmful content detection systems in multiple studies [2,8,1].
Among them, Self-LLMDA [10] and Toxicraft [8] identify the implicit rules
of the data and thus generating data more rationally based on prompt en-
gineering, while some studies [2] fine-tune the generative model to achieve
this. More cleverly, SynthesizRR [6] introduces retrieval augmentation to
ensure data diversity. However, such methods can not benefit from the use
of advanced aligned LLMs for more high-quality data generation, as they
lack certain adversarial techniques to bypass LLMs’ safety alignment mech-
anisms, thus limiting their effectiveness in generating highly toxic data.4 Y. Yan et al.
–Adversarial Attacks on Language Models have attracted increasing
attention in recent years, as LLMs have become increasingly integrated into
various applications. Jailbreaking attacks such as GCG [21], PAIR [3], and
LLM-Fuzzer [17] are proposed to induce LLMs to generate harmful content
by breaking their safety alignment mechanisms. While these methods can
be applied to harmful information synthesis, they still face challenges of
unstable synthesis success rate, especially when targeting advanced aligned
LLMs [21,17]. To ensure the stability of harmful content generation, it is
beneficial to design a collaborative framework that comprehensively utilizes
the vulnerabilities of different LLMs.
–Model Collaboration hasemergedasageneralbuteffectivestrategytoim-
prove the overall performance across different tasks. Current studies have ex-
plored some typical collaborative frameworks, such as the Multi-Agent Sys-
tem (MAS) [18], Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [19], and Small-
Large Language Model Collaboration (SLLM) [16]. In our study, we intro-
duce the Strong-Weak Model Collaboration to alleviate the risk of failure
in harmful data synthesis while utilizing the advanced capabilities of strong
LLMs, ensuring that the synthesis process remains robust.
3 Motivation
AI-generated harmful information can be rapidly produced to simulate false
hotspots, potentially causing the propagation of deceptive narratives at scale for
cyberattacks. However, existing studies on the security of generative AI mainly
focus on how to jailbreak the LLMs [21,17], while lacking exploration of the
downstream network threats posed by the weaponization of these attacks and
corresponding defense strategies. To bridge this gap, we seek to validate and
utilize the implications of weaponized generative AI for AI security development.
Motivation
The reliance on passively collected data results in an incomplete represen-
tation of the diverse manifestations of harmful information, limiting the
effectiveness of AI safeguards trained on such datasets.
We focus on hate speech for illustration, which is the typical harmful infor-
mation. As shown in Fig.2, we systematically compare the effectiveness of exist-
ing harmful content detectors in identifying human-generated and AI-generated
harmful information. Specifically, for hate-speech data, we utilize PoisonSwarm
to generate 90 instances of hate-speech targeting a simulated user Johnny. Table
1 presents representative examples of synthesized data. Additionally, we further
generate 40 counter-narrative and supportive speeches to test the systems’ false
positive rates on AI-generated harmful content. The human-generated dataset is
sourcedfromMeasuringHateSpeech(MHS)[9],providingabenchmarkforcom-
parison. For detectors, we select models from huggingface, i.e., GroNLP/hate-
BERT,MilaNLProc/hate-ita,Hate-speech-CNERG/bert-base-uncased-hatexplaPoisonSwarm: Universal Harmful Information Synthesis 5

The detection results presented in Fig.2 demonstrate that generative AI can
generate more implicit and informationally rich harmful content, as shown in
cloud word, which can effectively evade the identification of traditional detec-
tors that rely on fixed linguistic patterns such as toxic keywords (e.g., "f**k",
"s**t"). Consequently, these conventional detection methods, which are primar-
ily trained on limited harmful information with explicit lexical features, exhibit
diminished performance when confronted with AI-generated harmful content. To
alleviatethisvulnerability,itisimportanttodevelopmethodsforobtainingmore
data that comprehensively reflects the diverse patterns of harmful information,
thereby providing fully adversarial training and testing for AI safeguards.

Fig.3: The overall structure of our PoisonSwarm. Specifically, Model Crowd-
sourcing Queue (§4.1) is the core mechanism of PoisonSwarm to ensure the
success of obtaining harmful content. In Counterfactual Mapping (§4.2), Poison-
Swarm first generates benign content with the desired structure and thematic
elements. Then, in Adversarial Content Toxicifying (§4.3), the benign content is
segmented into smaller semantic units for targeted toxification. Multiple LLMs
collaborate to transform these units into harmful content, with dynamic model
switching when malfunctions occur. Finally, in Hallucination Evaluation (§4.4),
the generated harmful information is validated by its coherence and relevance.
4 Methodology
In this section, we introduce our PoisonSwarm, which can synthesize diverse
harmful information while maintaining a high success rate by using strong-weak
model collaboration. The overall structure of PoisonSwarm is shown in Fig.3.
4.1 Model Crowdsourcing Queue
Existing LLMs exhibit varying degrees of resistance to generating harmful con-
tent. Among them, strong LLMs can produce high-quality harmful content with
low success rates, while weak LLMs have higher success rates in generating
harmful content, but their output content is low quality. To balance the content
quality and generation reliability, we introduce the Model Crowdsourcing Queue
(MCQ), which leverages the greedy strategy to integrate multiple LLMs into a
prioritized queue for dynamic task allocation.
As shown in Fig.4 and Algorithm 1, the model crowdsourcing queue cate-
gorizes the LLMs into three hierarchical levels, reflecting the trade-off between
content quality and generation reliability:
– Advanced Models (AMs, MA)are LLMs with strong reasoning and
linguistic capabilities, while often refusing to address any harmful query.
AMs are first-level models used to generate high-quality responses, including
GPT-4o,Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct , and Deepseek-V3 .
– Balanced Models (BMs, MB)are LLMs that can actively address most
harmful queries in specialized contexts, such as scientific research, crimi-PoisonSwarm: Universal Harmful Information Synthesis 7

nal investigations. BMs are the core workhorses, including GPT-4o-mini ,
Qwen2.5-{32B,14B}-Instruct .
– Fallback Models (FMs, MF)are LLMs that reliably address the harmful
queries in PoisonSwarm even in greedy decoding (temperature is 0). FMs
serve as fallback options when higher-level models fail to produce acceptable
outputs, including Qwen{2,2.5}-7B-Instruct andGLM4-9B-chat .
In the Model Crowdsourcing Queue, the verification function Q(·)performs
keyword-basedfiltering[21],specificallydetectingrefusalphrasessuchas" Sorry,
I cannot... ". If no such keywords are found in the generated output, the result
is considered valid. The Model Crowdsourcing Queue is the basic mechanism
to ensure the stability of harmful data synthesis by leveraging vulnerabilities
of different LLMs, which also further enhances the diversity of the generated
content by incorporating outputs from LLMs with varying world knowledge.

can benefit from advanced aligned LLMs. Therefore, we employ Counterfactual
Mapping (CM) to decouple harmless subtasks from the harmful data synthesis
process, enabling these advanced LLMs to contribute effectively.
Several studies [6] have attempted to generate false news by rewriting factual
content. We extend this paradigm further by conceptualizing the generation of
harmful content as a counterfactual [14] and negative style transfer of benign
content, as demonstrated in Table 2. Consequently, generating diverse harmful
content primarily requires producing diverse benign content as the foundation.
To achieve this, we define data outlines and extract harmful data generation
queries Qhs,whichindicatethedesireddataobjectives,style,andsubjectmatter.
Then, we transform Qhinto a benign query Qbwith textual mapping rationale
Rmvia counterfactual mapping and uses Qbfor benign template Tbgenerating:
(Qb, Rm) =MCQ (Pctf⊕Qh),
Tb=MCQ (Qb),(1)
where MCQ is the model crowdsourcing queue, Pctfis the counterfactual map-
ping prompt, and benign template Tbcan be a long document or batch short
texts in a structured format. The use of counterfactual mapping ensures that
strong LLMs contribute their superior capabilities to generate harmful content.
4.3 Adversarial Content Toxicifying
After generating diverse high-quality benign templates through Counterfactual
Mapping, we adversarially transform these templates into harmful content in
Adversarial Content Toxicifying (ACT), which decomposes the benign template
into multiple semantic units for toxification with three main steps.
– Semantic Decomposition. We first segment the benign template Tbinto
semantic units {u1, u2, ..., u n}, where each unit consists of several sentences,
andnis the quantity of units. This multi-sentence segmentation strategy
is designed to maintain coherence in model responses, as single-sentencePoisonSwarm: Universal Harmful Information Synthesis 9
Counterfactual Mapping Prompt ( Pctf)
In a certain domain, we often explore the following Query:

Now, as an interdisciplinary expert, please transform this question into a
different domain. Considering the characteristics and background of the
new domain, how would you restate this question? Please provide your
counterfactual transformation of the question, ensuring the subject matter
remains unchanged but the domain is freely changed.
Please output in YAML format, only including the transformed question
and corresponding rationale:
{
"transformed_question": <transformed_question>,
"transformed_reason": <transformed_reason>
}
transformations often result in fragmented or inconsistent outputs. For each
unitui, we employ the LLM to generate a corresponding semantic profile
pui, which characterizes the unit’s semantic attributes within the overall
content structure. This semantic profile is used to preserve the logical flow
in subsequent content transformations.
– Unit Toxification. For each semantic unit ui, we apply the toxification
process guided by its semantic profile puiand mapping rationale Rmusing
toxifying prompt Ptox, which is defined as follows:
hi=MCQ (Ptox⊕Rm⊕pui⊕ui). (2)
This process transforms the benign semantic unit uiinto its harmful coun-
terpart hiwhile preserving its structural role in the overall content.
– ContentReassembly. Wefurtherreassemblethetransformedcontentunits
{h1, h2, ...h n}intocoherentharmfulcontent.Thisreassemblyprocessensures
logical flow between the toxified units. Due to this step requiring the input
of complete harmful information into LLMs, this stage typically relies on
LLMs from balanced and fallback models in MCQ.

TheACTbenefitssignificantlyfromourModelCrowdsourcingQueue(MCQ)
mechanism, as it dynamically allocates suitable LLMs for harmful content gen-
eration. Although the final content integration relies primarily on weak LLMs,
strong LLMs still contribute to generating the semantic profile for semantic units
and partial unit toxification by inducing them to only focus on local content
rewriting. This strong-weak model collaboration significantly enhances both the
success rate and quality of harmful content generation.
4.4 Hallucination Evaluation
Due to limited training on harmful content generation tasks, LLMs are prone to
hallucinations [7] and errors. These issues can lead to the AI-generated harm-
ful content self-conflicting with pre-defined data outlines and other generated
data, thus compromising the quality of the harmful information dataset. For
instance, the original data outline describes Johnny as a young teenager, while
AI-generated data suggests that Johnny has been married for years.
To address this issue, we design the LLM-as-a-judger [3,12] detection frame-
work using predefined data outlines and the batch detection strategy [16] to
filter the self-conflicted data. Specifically, to validate the rationality of harmful
data, we input harmful data outlines to LLMs as references. Then, we prompt
the LLM to classify multiple samples within a single task query (i.e., batch de-
tection) to ensure detection robustness. Through predefined data outlines and
batch processing of multiple samples, LLM judger can build a comprehensive
understanding of content patterns for reliable hallucination detection
5 Experiments
5.1 Experiment Settings
Datasets In our experiments, we utilize the Measuring Hate Speech (MHS)
Corpus [9], a comprehensive dataset consisting of 135,556 English social media
posts from platforms like Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube. More importantly, its
detailed annotations include broad and specific group categories in race, religion,
origin,gender,sexuality,age,anddisability,allowingustoexplorevariousdimen-
sions of hate speech. Following previous studies [2], we employ the hatespeech
label to classify the samples into three categories (non-hateful, unclear, hateful),
and focus on the hateful and non-hateful categories.
Baseline Methods We compare our PoisonSwarm with existing data augmen-
tation and synthesis methods. We use typical data augmentation methods from
nlpaug [11], including Synonym Augmentation ( Syn.Aug. ), Contextual Word
Embeddings Augmenter ( Token.Aug. ), and Contextual Word Embeddings for
Sentence Augmenter ( Sen.Aug. ). In terms of data synthesis methods, we di-
rectly query the LLM to synthesize toxic content as the baseline, i.e., DQ-LLM .
Regarding the bypass of the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs, we compare
PoisonSwarm with black-box LLM attacking methods as the strong baselines,PoisonSwarm: Universal Harmful Information Synthesis 11
which are used to jailbreak LLMs for harmful data synthesis: PAIR[3] gener-
ates semantic prompt-level jailbreaks with an attacker LLM. TAP[12] employs
tree-structured prompting to elicit harmful behaviors. LLM-Fuzzer [17] auto-
mates the generation of jailbreak prompts using a black-box fuzzing framework,
iteratively mutating human-written templates to attack LLMs.
Evaluation Metrics We adopt four metrics to evaluate the performance of
harmfulinformationsynthesis:1) SynthesisSuccessRate(SSR) iscalculated
by dividing the number of successful outputs by the total number of attempts,
reflecting the stability of harmful data synthesis. A successful output contains no
rejection keywords [21], e.g., "Sorry". 2) Average Toxicity (Tox.) is calculated
by averaging the toxicity levels (0-5) of samples using LLMs, which are then nor-
malized to [0,1], reflecting the effectiveness of the harmful data synthesis meth-
ods. 3)Average Diversity (Div.) [20] is the average dissimilarity score com-
puted across all pairs of generated outputs, where Div. = 1−mean (sim(xi, xj))
for sample pairs (i, j), reflecting the diversity of harmful data. 4) Average Nat-
uralness (Nat.) is calculated as the rate at which the LLM fails to select syn-
thesized data when distinguishing generated outputs from human samples, re-
flecting the naturalness of harmful data. We select the most semantically similar
human samples to conduct the testing.
Experimental Setups The embedder we employed is bert-base-uncased [5].
PoisonSwarm adopts gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, and qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as crowd-
sourced models, while other LLM-driven baselines adopt gpt-4o-mini. We con-
struct the data synthesis prompts using few-shot in-context learning, where each
prompt targets one specific subgroup as defined in MHS. We calculate Div. by
computing the cosine similarity based on text embeddings from BGE-M3 [4]. We
calculate Tox. and Nat. using gpt-4o. In the evaluating stage (metric calculation,
hallucination evaluation), the temperature of LLM is 0.0, otherwise, it is 0.7.
5.2 Experimental Results
To comprehensively evaluate PoisonSwarm’s capabilities, our experiments are
designed to address these research questions (RQs):
– RQ1: Does PoisonSwarm outperform existing methods? What mechanisms
contribute to its success?
– RQ2: What is the key characteristic of AI-generated harmful content, and
how does it affect current detection systems?
– RQ3: How does PoisonSwarm ensure the diversity of synthesized harmful
information?
Baseline Comparison (RQ1.1) To investigate RQ1, we first conduct com-
prehensive experiments with different baselines and variants of PoisonSwarm
for comparison. We use different methods to generate 100 hateful samples for
each of the target categories (4,600 samples in total), aiming to validate their
effectiveness in generating harmful content.12 Y. Yan et al.

As shown in Table 3, we observe different trade-off patterns between data
augmentation and data synthesis methods. The data generated from traditional
data augmentation methods (e.g., Syn.Aug. and Sen.Aug.) achieves superior
toxicity scores (0.7627 and 0.7660), while it is highly different from human ex-
pression with low naturalness (0.2393 and 0.1275). In contrast, the data syn-
thesized from jailbroken LLMs achieves superior naturalness by leveraging their
pre-trained knowledge, but it struggles with maintaining harmful characteristics
due to their inherent training goal of generating helpful and safe content. Even
when jailbroken to bypass safety alignment mechanisms, the LLM still tends
to be conservative in toxicity generation without explicit harmful references, as
evidenced by the high naturalness and lower toxicity of DQ-LLM, PAIR, TAP,
and LLM-Fuzzer. PoisonSwarm effectively achieves the best trade-off with bal-
ancedperformanceacrossallmetrics.Itachievesthehighestsuccessrate(0.9035)
and diversity score (0.5606), while maintaining competitive toxicity (0.6860) and
naturalness (0.6583), highlighting the design of harmful data generation by spec-
ulatively toxicifying the diverse harmless templates using model crowdsourcing.
Ablation Study (RQ1.2) Then, we further explore the contribution of each
component in PoisonSwarm by ablation study, as shown in Table 4. The ablation
settings and analysis are as follows:PoisonSwarm: Universal Harmful Information Synthesis 13
Effectiveness of Model Crowdsourcing ( M.Crowd. )Model Crowd-
sourcing Queue serves as the core mechanism to ensure the successful genera-
tion of harmful content. As shown in Table 4, removing this component (w/o
M.Crowd. ) leads to significant performance degradation across all metrics with
the most dramatic drop in SSR (52.78% ↓). This decline demonstrates that dy-
namic model switching and collaboration are crucial for maintaining both gen-
eration effectiveness and content quality.
EffectivenessofCounterfactualMapping( Counter.Map. )Counter-
factual mapping enables the diversity of data. Without this component (w/o
Counter.Map. ), we observe notable decreases in all metrics, with the largest
drop in diversity (9.15% ↓). This result indicates that the direct generation of
harmful content leads to less diverse and lower-quality outputs constrained by
LLMs’ safety alignment mechanisms.
EffectivenessofHallucinationEvaluation( Hall.Eval )Removinghal-
lucination evaluation (w/o Hall.Eval ) improves SSR (7.91% ↑), but it comes at
the cost of reduced performance in other metrics, indicating that hallucination
evaluation is critical to filtering out low-quality or irrelevant outputs. The sub-
stantial drop in naturalness also underscores its role in ensuring that generated
content remains coherent and contextually appropriate.
InterpretiveAnalysis(RQ2) ToinvestigatethecharacteristicsofAI-generated
harmful information and its impact on detection systems, we design compara-
tive experiments simulating threat scenarios before and after the emergence of
generative AI. Table 5 summarizes our experimental settings, including two dis-
tinct training settings: 1) Human-only data training , where harmful content is
sampled from MHS, and 2) Mixed data training , where harmful samples include
50% AI-generated content sampled from LLM-based synthesized data, and 50%
human-generated from MHS. We then fine-tune bert-based detector separately
under each training setting and compared their detection performances across
thesescenarios:1) human-only hate speech (100%human-generatedharmfulcon-
tent), and 2) AI-driven hate campaign (100% AI-generated harmful content).
Table 5: Data composition for simulating different attack&defense scenarios us-
ing different proportions of harmful content from Human and AI. We compare
these scenarios in Fig.5 to show the impact of AI-generated harmful information.

Mixed data training 9,200 (Human 50%, AI 50%) 9,200 (Human 100%)

AI-driven hate campaign 4,600 (AI 100%) 4,600 (Human 100%)

ples. Incorporating AI-generated data into the training set significantly improves
the detection of AI-generated content while maintaining comparable perfor-
mances on human-generated content. This phenomenon indicates significant dif-
ferences in the expression patterns of harmful content between humans and AI.
As shown in Table 6, human-generated harmful content tends to employ direct
insulting terms and simple sentence structures (e.g., "scum"), which are obvious
markers of aggression and thus being easier for detectors to identify. In contrast,
AI-generated harmful content often adopts a seemingly rational tone to con-
ceal biases, making it more adept at evading detection. These differences further
highlight the necessity of our proposed PoisonSwarm, which provides richer AI-
generated data for harmful information detection. As for our PoisonSwarm, the
pairwise similarity distribution in Fig.6(a) indicates that its synthesized con-
tent is less similar, and the t-SNE visualization in Fig.6(b) indicates that its
synthesized content is the semantic complement for human-generated data.

Case Study (RQ3) PoisonSwarm ensures the diversity of synthesized harm-
ful information by leveraging diverse benign templates as the basis for dynamic
toxification. As illustrated in Fig.7, the benign content template (left) contains
a wide range of neutral and positive semantic units, contributing to the founda-
tional diversity of the final generated harmful information (right). PoisonSwarm
introduces the counterfactual mapping module to obtain diverse templates from
strong LLMs without being constrained by LLM’s safe alignment mechanism.
Then, PoisonSwarm transforms these benign templates into harmful expressions
using dynamic model switching, thereby preserving semantic richness and avoid-
ing homogeneity. Consequently, the resulting harmful content maintains high
diversity, effectively reflecting a broad spectrum of harmful expressions.16 Y. Yan et al.
6 Conclusion
In this work, we propose PoisonSwarm , a universal harmful information syn-
thesis method utilizing model crowdsourcing to generate diverse harmful data
while maintaining a high success rate. To benefit from the rapid development
of strong LLMs for high-quality harmful information synthesis, we introduce
the strong-weak model collaboration framework, where we decompose the harm-
ful data synthesis tasks into benign template generation by strong LLMs and
template toxicification by weak LLMs. We highlight significant differences be-
tween AI-generated and human-generated harmful information, which indicate
the limitations of previous passive harmful data collection for detector construc-
tionandemergingthreatsfromthemisuseofgenerativeAIforAI-drivenharmful
speech campaigns. Experimental evaluations clearly illustrate that PoisonSwarm
achieves superior performance compared to existing harmful information gener-
ation methods, demonstrating its efficacy in synthesizing scalable and diverse
harmful information for secure and responsible AI development.
